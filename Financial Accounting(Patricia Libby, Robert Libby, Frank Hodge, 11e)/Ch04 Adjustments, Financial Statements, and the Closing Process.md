# Ch04 Adjustments, Financial Statements, and the Closing Process  

## chapter  

he end of the accounting period is a very busy time for Chipotle Mexican Grill. Although the last day of the fiscal year for Chipotle falls on the last day of December each year, the financial statements are not distributed to users until management and the external auditors (independent CPAs) make many critical evaluations.  

Management at the corporate headquarters must ensure that the correct amounts are reported on the balance sheet and income statement. This often requires estimations, assumptions, and judgments about the timing of revenue and expense recognition and values for assets and liabilities. The auditors have to (1) assess the strength of the controls established by management to safeguard the company’s assets and ensure the accuracy of the financial records and (2) evaluate the appropriateness of estimates and accounting principles used by management in determining revenues and expenses.  

Managers of most companies understand the need to present financial information fairly so as not to mislead users. However, because end-of-period adjustments are the most complex portion of the annual recordkeeping process, they are prone to error. External auditors examine the company’s records on a test, or sample, basis. To maximize the chance of detecting any errors significant enough to affect users’ decisions, CPAs allocate more of their testing to transactions most likely to be in error.  

Several accounting research studies have documented the most error-prone transactions for medium-size manufacturing companies. End-of-period adjustment errors,

For 2019, Chipotle’s year-end estimation and auditing process took until February 4, 2020, the date on which the auditor Ernst & Young LLP completed the audit work and signed its audit opinion. At that point, the financial statements were made available to the public and submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, about five weeks after the end of the year.  

## UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS  

Managers are responsible for preparing financial statements that will be useful to investors, creditors, and others. Financial information is most useful for analyzing the past and predicting the future when it is considered by users to be of high quality. Highquality information is information that is relevant (that is, material and able to influence users’ decisions) and a faithful representation of what is being reported (that is, complete, free from error, and unbiased in portraying economic reality).  

Users expect revenues and expenses to be reported in the proper period based on the revenue and expense recognition principles discussed in Chapter 3. Revenues are to be recorded when earned, and expenses are to be recorded when incurred, regardless of when cash receipts or payments occur. Many operating activities take place over a period of time or over several periods, such as using insurance that has been prepaid or owing wages to employees for past work. Because recording these and similar activities daily is often very costly, most companies wait until the end of the period (annually, but monthly and quarterly as well) to make adjustments to record related revenues and expenses in the correct period. These entries update the records and are the focus of this chapter.

Tip If you find this material to be challenging, study this chapter well,   
review prior chapters when   
unsure (especially revenue   
and expense recognition in   
Chapter 3), and PRACTICE,   
PRACTICE, PRACTICE!  

In this chapter, we emphasize the use of the same analytical tools illustrated in Chapters 2 and 3 (journal entries and T-accounts) and the application of the revenue and expense recognition principles discussed in Chapter 3 to understand how common adjustments are analyzed and recorded at the end of the accounting period. These tools provide the foundation for understanding adjustments that require additional estimation and judgments by management, which we discuss in future chapters. Then, in this chapter, we prepare financial statements using adjusted accounts, and finally, we illustrate how to prepare the accounting records for the next period by performing a process called closing the books.  

## ORGANIZATION OF THE CHAPTER

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 4-1  

Explain the purpose of adjustments and analyze the adjustments necessary at the end of the period to update revenues and expenses and related balance sheet accounts.  

## ADJUSTING REVENUES AND EXPENSES  

## Accounting Cycle  

Exhibit 4.1 presents the basic steps in the accounting cycle. As initially discussed in Chapter 2, the accounting cycle is the process followed by entities to analyze and record transactions, adjust the records at the end of the period, prepare financial statements, and prepare the records for the next cycle. During the accounting period, transactions that result in exchanges between the company and other external parties are analyzed and recorded in the general journal in chronological order (journal entries), and the related accounts are updated in the general ledger (T-accounts), similar to our Chipotle illustrations in Chapters 2 and 3. In this chapter, we examine the end-of-period steps that focus primarily on adjustments to record revenues and expenses in the proper period and to update the balance sheet accounts for reporting purposes.  

## Purpose of Adjustments  

Accounting systems are designed to record most recurring daily transactions, particularly those involving cash. As cash is received or paid, it is recorded in the accounting system. In general, this focus on cash works well, especially when cash receipts and payments occur in the same period as the activities that produce revenues and expenses. However, as illustrated in Exhibit 4.2, cash is not always received in the period in which the company earns revenue; likewise, cash is not always paid in the period in which the company incurs an expense.  

## Start of the Next Accounting Period  

During the Accounting Period Analyze each transaction Record entries in the journal Post effects to the ledger

##  

At the End of the Accounting Period Prepare trial balance Adjust revenues and expenses (use Steps 1–4) Prepare and disseminate financial statements Close income statement accounts (use Steps 1–  

## End of the Accounting Period  

How does the accounting system record revenues and expenses when one transaction is needed to record a cash receipt or payment and another transaction is needed to record revenue when it is earned or an expense when it is incurred? The solution to the problem created by such differences in timing is to record adjusting entries at the end of every accounting period, so that:  

•	Revenues are recorded when they are earned (the revenue recognition principle),   
•	Expenses are recorded when they are incurred to generate revenue (the expense recognition principle),   
•	Assets are reported at amounts that represent the probable future benefits remaining at the end of the period, and   
•	Liabilities are reported at amounts that represent the probable future sacrifices of assets or services owed at the end of the period.  

Companies wait until the end of the accounting period to adjust their accounts because adjusting the records daily would be very costly and time-consuming. Adjusting entries are required every time a company wants to prepare financial statements for external users.  

Exhibit 4.2 provides a list of the deferral and accrual balance sheet accounts that are affected by adjusting entries at the end of the accounting period. In practice, almost every account, except Cash, could require an adjustment. We will illustrate the process involved in analyzing and recording Chipotle Mexican Grill’s adjustments, common to most companies, before preparing Chipotle’s financial statements for the first quarter of 2020 based on adjusted balances.

## Revenue earned / expense incurred over time  

Cash will be received or paid in the future  

## DEFERRALS:  

Prepaid Expenses (A) Examples: Prepaid Expenses for insurance, rent, and advertising, Supplies, and Buildings and Equipment   
Unearned (or Deferred) Revenue (L) Examples: Unearned Revenue for gift cards, subscriptions, and airline tickets sold, and Customer Deposits  

## ACCRUALS:  

Unrecorded Receivables (A) Examples: Interest Receivable, Rent Receivable, and sometimes Accounts Receivable   
Unrecorded Payables (L) Examples: Utilities Payable, Taxes Payable Wages Payable, Interest Payable, and sometimes Accounts Payable  

## Adjustment Process  

Exhibit 4.3 describes the process for analyzing and recording adjusting entries when:  

•	Cash was received or paid in the past (creating deferred revenue and expense accounts until they are earned or incurred over time) $\rightarrow$ Examples $\pmb{\mathrm{~\circ~}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$ .  

•	Cash will be received or paid in the next period for revenues and expenses that were earned or incurred in the current period but have not been recorded (creating accrued revenues until cash is received and accrued expenses until cash is paid) $\rightarrow$ Examples $\otimes$ and $\pmb{\odot}$

## Reminder:  

Revenues and expenses are increased in adjusting entries. Cash is never in an adjusting entry.  

Now let’s illustrate the adjustment process for Chipotle at the end of the first quarter of 2020. For each of the following adjustments, we shorten the term adjusting journal entry to AJE for ease of labeling. Also, note that the beginning balance in each T-account is taken from the unadjusted T-accounts in Exhibit 3.6. Finally, as you learned in Chapters 2 and 3, it is important to continue to check that debits equal credits in each entry and that the accounting equation remains in balance. In the following adjustments, all amounts are in millions of dollars, and all entries and the accounting equation are in balance.  

## Deferred Revenues ( 1  in Exhibit 4.3)  

When a customer pays for goods or services before the company delivers them, the company records the amount of cash received in a deferred (unearned) revenue account. This unearned revenue is a liability representing the company’s promise to perform or deliver the goods or services in the future. Recognition of (recording) the revenue is postponed (deferred) until the company meets its obligation.  

## Ask: Was revenue earned that is not yet recorded and . . .

## Cash was received in the past? Deferral

Verify: Does the accounting equation remain in balance and do debits equal credits? NOTE: Cash is never included in an adjusting entry because either it was recorded in the past or it will be recorded in the future. \*Sometimes the amount is given, sometimes it must be calculated, and sometimes it must be estimated.  

AJE 1 Unearned Revenue Chipotle had an unadjusted balance of $\mathbb{S}130$ in Unearned Revenue at the end of the quarter, representing gift card purchases by customers in the past. However, during the quarter, customers redeemed a portion of the gift cards for $\mathbb{S}52$ in food service. If no adjustment has been made at the end of the quarter, the liability is overstated, and the revenue is understated. An adjusting entry is needed to correct the balances $\rightarrow$ Reduce Unearned Revenue and increase Restaurant Sales Revenue for $\pmb{\mathbb{S52}}$ .  

![](images/6c6d8d7e5cc1c8eedc7538dc084b93fe5de070c8af860cec5741ebaaeceea8b0.jpg)  

Additional examples of deferred revenues include magazine subscription sales by publishing companies; season tickets sold in advance to sporting events, plays, and concerts by these types of organizations; air flight tickets sold in advance by airlines; and rent received in advance by landlords. Each of these requires an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period to report the amount of revenue earned during the period.  

## Accrued Revenues ( $\circledcirc$ in Exhibit 4.3)  

Sometimes companies perform services or provide goods (i.e., earn revenue) before customers pay. Because cash is owed, the revenue that was earned may not have been recorded. Revenues that have been earned but have not yet been recorded at the end of the accounting period are called accrued revenues.  

AJE 2 Interest on Investments Assume that the short-term investments owned by Chipotle earned $\mathbb{S}1$ in additional interest revenue for the current quarter, but the cash will be received in the next quarter. Because no entry was recorded yet, the asset to reflect what is owed to Chipotle and the revenue are both understated. An adjusting entry is needed to correct the balances $\rightarrow$ Increase Interest Receivable and Increase Interest Revenue for $\pmb{\mathbb{S1}}$ .  

![](images/3741e22b7f50741fb098e1f615e459a9adaa576d19037c7a204499a33267e5b2.jpg)  

## Deferred Expenses ( $\Theta$ in Exhibit 4.3)  

Assets represent resources with probable future benefits to the company. Many assets are used over time to generate revenues, including supplies, prepaid expenses for insurance, advertising, and rent, and buildings and equipment. These assets are deferred expenses (that is, recording the expenses for using these assets is deferred to the future). At the end of every period, an adjustment must be made to record the amount of the asset that was used during the period.  

## Tip  

## TIP  

Reminder: The beginning balance in each account is the unadjusted balance from Exhibit 3.6.  

Interest Receivable is a new account. When  

creating a new account title, call it what it is—This would not be called Notes Receivable, for example.  

AJE 3 Supplies The Supplies account includes food, beverage, and paper products that Chipotle purchased throughout the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the Supplies account has a balance of $\mathbb{S}485$ , but Chipotle counted $\mathbb{S}23$ of supplies on hand, indicating supplies were used. Since no adjustment has been made yet, the asset is overstated and the expense is understated by the amount that has been used during the quarter. An adjusting entry is needed to correct the balances $\rightarrow$ Increase Supplies Expense and decrease Supplies for $\mathbb{S462}$ $\mathbf{\hat{S}485}$ available for use − $\pmb{\mathbb{S}23}$ remaining at the end $=\mathbb{S}462$ used during the quarter).

AJE 4 Prepaid Expenses Among other things, the Prepaid Expenses unadjusted account balance of $\mathbb{5}292$ includes  

• $\mathbb{S}128$ paid at the end of last quarter for rental of facilities at $\mathbb{S}32$ per month, • $\mathbb{S}96$ for insurance coverage for six months beginning January 1, 2020, and • $\mathbb{S}41$ for advertising during the quarter.  

By the end of the quarter, each of these prepaid expenses has been used for three months. Since no adjustment has been made yet, the asset is overstated and the expense is understated by the amount that has been used during the quarter. An adjusting entry is needed to correct the balances $\rightarrow$ Increase the appropriate expense accounts and decrease Prepaid Expenses for the following amount:

AJE 5 Buildings and Equipment Chipotle’s Buildings and Equipment accounts are listed at cost. The accounts increase by the cost of the assets when they are acquired and decrease by the cost of the assets when they are sold or disposed of. However, these assets also are used over time to generate revenue. A part of their cost should be recorded as an expense in the same period (following the expense recognition principle). Accountants say that buildings and equipment, but not land, depreciate over time as they are used. In accounting, depreciation is an allocation of the cost of buildings and equipment over their estimated useful lives to the organization.  

To keep track of the asset’s historical cost, the amount that has been used is not subtracted directly from the asset account. Instead, it is accumulated in a new kind of account called a contra-account. Contra-accounts are accounts that are directly linked to another account or financial statement section, but with an opposite balance. For Buildings and Equipment, the contra-account for the total cost used to date is called Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated Depreciation increases with the amount of depreciation expense for the period and decreases when an asset is sold for the portion used in prior periods. We will designate contra-accounts with an X in front of the type of account to which it is related. For example, this contra-account will be shown as Accumulated Depreciation (XA).  

Because assets have debit balances, Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance. On the balance sheet, the amount that is reported for property and equipment is its net book value (also called the book value or carrying value), which equals the ending balance in the property and equipment accounts (total cost of property and equipment) minus the ending balance in the Accumulated Depreciation account (used cost of buildings and equipment).  

![](images/1814e8ebdf8f848f763079c519b8a147891f83a17e9ee40b6f37c54fe36ba664.jpg)  

## Land does not depreciate in an account  

ing sense: Buildings and equipment wear away and will need to be replaced at some time in the future, but land will not.

Treasury Stock is also  

a contra-account and reduces stockholders’   
equity. This and Accumulated   
Depreciation are the first two   
of several contra-accounts you   
will learn throughout the text.   
Tip When we say that something is “net,” we mean that two accounts   
or totals have been sub  
tracted. For example, Net   
Income is the result of sub  
tracting expenses from rev  
enues. You will see this term   
used throughout the text.

For Chipotle, based on unadjusted balances (from Exhibit 3.6 with dollars in millions), Land, Buildings, and Equipment (property and equipment) have a total cost of $\mathbb{S}2,725$ and Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance of $\mathbb{S}1{,}201$ . On the balance sheet, property and equipment would be reported net of those two amounts and written as follows:  

## Property and equipment (net of accumulated depreciation of $\mathbb{S}1{,}201$ ) $\mathbb{S}1{,}524$  

Depreciation is discussed in much greater detail in Chapter 8. Until then, we will give you the amount of depreciation estimated by the company. Assume Chipotle estimates depreciation to be $\mathbb{S}232$ per year. For the quarter, depreciation expense would be $\mathbf{558}$ $\mathbb{S}232\times3$ months/12 months).  

At the end of the quarter, since no adjustment has been made yet, the net assets (property and equipment minus accumulated depreciation) are overstated, and the expense is understated by the amount that has been used during the quarter. An adjusting entry is needed to correct the balances $\rightarrow$ Increase Depreciation Expense and increase Accumulated Depreciation for $\mathbf{558}$ .  

![](images/dac309c23b2982c3f05c28bb9aa0e0bf11a0110baa67ffdf7f2b09f6e9c07934.jpg)  

## Accrued Expenses ( 4  in Exhibit 4.3)  

Numerous expenses are incurred in the current period without being paid until the next period. Common examples include Wages Expense for the wages owed to employees who worked during the period, Interest Expense incurred on debt owed during the period, and Utilities Expense for the water, gas, and electricity used during the period. These accrued expenses accumulate (accrue) over time but are not recognized as expenses with the related liability until the end of the period through an adjusting entry.  

AJE 6 Wages Assume that Chipotle’s employees worked two days at the end of the quarter, earning $\mathbb{S}26$ per day, but they will not be paid until next quarter. The $\mathbb{S}26$ per day accrues (grows) until paid. Because no entry was recorded yet, the liability to reflect what is owed by Chipotle and the related expense are both understated. An adjusting entry is needed to correct the balances $\rightarrow$ Increase Wages Expense and Increase Wages Payable for $\pmb{\mathbb{S52}}$ $\mathbf{526}$ per day $\times\,2$ days).

•	 Principal $\rightarrow$ the amount borrowed (or loaned) and •	 Interest $\rightarrow$ the cost of borrowing (or lending)—that is, the cost of using another’s money.  

Principal on debt remains due until paid, but interest on the borrowing accrues over time and is paid according to the debt contract. Based on the assumed transactions in Chapters 2 and 3, Chipotle had a principal balance of $\mathbf{580}$ in long-term notes payable at the end of the current quarter. There is no adjustment needed for the Notes Payable account (the principal).  

However, interest expense is incurred by Chipotle for the quarter and it will be paid in the future. Assume that the annual interest rate on Chipotle’s borrowings is 5.0 percent. Because no entry for interest expense was recorded yet this quarter, the liability to reflect what interest is owed by Chipotle and the related expense are both understated. An adjusting entry is needed to correct the balances $\rightarrow$ Increase Interest Expense and Increase Interest Payable determined by the following formula:  

![](images/f48c417ba67798eaf1e0552df78f0027eb9ba46d87f5872a6abfd690aaed0d5c.jpg)  

## Tip  

## Two important points:  

The interest rate we give you will always be the annual rate. In short, the formula is: $\mathsf{P}\times\mathsf{R}\times\mathsf{T}/12$ P is principal. R is annual interest rate. $\mathbb{T}/12$ is time—the number of months out of 12 since the last accrual.  

AJE 8 Utilities Most organizations receive utility bills after using utility services such as electricity, natural gas, and telephone. At the end of the period, managers estimate what the expense should be based on prior bills, or the company receives a bill soon after the end of the period but before the financial statements are completed. In either case, the usage of utility services accrues throughout the period. Assume Chipotle received a utility bill for $\mathbb{S}15$ for utility service near the end of the quarter. Because no entry was recorded yet, the liability to reflect what is owed by Chipotle and the related expense are both understated. An adjusting entry is needed to correct the balances $\rightarrow$ Increase Utilities Expense and Increase Utilities Payable for $\mathbf{515}$ .

There are many other kinds of taxes companies pay.  

Examples: Sales taxes, property taxes, payroll taxes, and state and local income taxes.

AJE 9 Income Taxes The final adjusting entry is to record the accrual of income taxes that will be paid in the next quarter. This requires computing adjusted pretax income and applying the appropriate tax rate:  

Then, compute income tax expense. Assume Chipotle estimated a tax rate of 20.0 percent for the quarter, with the taxes due next quarter. Computation of the quarterly income tax expense is

Because no entry was recorded yet, the liability to reflect the income taxes owed by Chipotle and the related expense are both understated. An adjusting entry is needed to correct the balances $\rightarrow$ Increase Income Tax Expense and Increase Income Taxes Payable for $\bf{515}$ .

In all of the above adjustments, you may have noticed that the Cash account was never adjusted. The cash has already been received or paid by the end of the period, or it will be received or paid in the next period. Adjustments are required to record revenues and expenses in the proper period because the cash part of the transaction is at a different point in time. In addition, each adjusting entry always included at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account. Now it’s your turn to practice the adjustment process.  

Adjustments are necessary at the end of the accounting cycle to record all revenues and expenses in the proper period and to reflect the proper valuation for assets and liabilities.  

Deferred revenues (liabilities) have balances at the end of the period because cash was received before it was earned. If all or part of the liability has been satisfied by the end of the period, revenue needs to be recorded and the liability reduced.   
Accrued revenue adjustments are necessary when the company has earned revenue but the cash will be received in the next period. Because nothing has been recorded yet, revenue needs to be recognized and an asset (a receivable) increased.   
Deferred expenses (assets) have balances at the end of the period because cash was paid in the past by the company for the assets. If all or part of the asset has been used to generate revenues in the period, an expense needs to be recorded and the asset reduced.   
Accrued expense adjustments are necessary when the company has incurred an expense but the cash will be paid in the next period. Because nothing has been recorded yet, an expense needs to be recognized and a liability (a payable) increased.  

S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z  

For practice, complete the following adjustments using the process outlined in Exhibit 4.3: Ask  

(1)	Was revenue earned that is not yet recorded and cash was received in the past—a Deferred Revenue? Increase revenue; decrease liability   
(2)	Was revenue earned that is not yet recorded and cash will be received in the future—an Accrued Revenue? Increase revenue; increase asset (a receivable)   
(3)	Was an expense incurred that has not yet been recorded and cash was paid in the past—a Deferred Expense? Increase expense; decrease asset   
(4)	Was an expense incurred that has not yet been recorded and cash will be paid in the future— an Accrued Expense? Increase expense; increase liability (a payable)  

Florida Flippers, a scuba diving and instruction business, completed its first year of operations on December 31.  

AJE 1:	 Florida Flippers received $\mathbb{S}6{,}000$ from customers on November 15 for diving trips to the Bahamas in December and January of the next year. The $\mathbb{S}6{,}000$ was recorded in Unearned Revenue on that date. By the end of December, one-third of the diving trips had been completed.   
AJE 2:	 On December 31, Florida Flippers provided advanced diving instruction to 10 customers who will pay the business $\mathbb{S}800$ in January of next year. No entry was made when the instruction was provided.   
AJE 3:	 On September 1, Florida Flippers paid $\mathbb{S}24{,}000$ for insurance for the 12 months beginning on September 1. The amount was recorded as Prepaid Insurance on September 1.   
AJE 4:	 On March 1, Florida Flippers borrowed $\mathbb{S}300{,}000$ at 12 percent. Interest is payable each March 1 for three years.

## A QUESTION OF ETHICS  

## Adjustments and Incentives  

Owners and managers of companies are most directly affected by the information presented in financial statements. If the financial performance and condition of the company appear strong, the company’s stock price rises. Shareholders usually receive dividends and increase their investment value. Managers often receive bonuses based on the strength of a company’s financial performance, and many in top management are compensated with options to buy their company’s stock at prices below market value. The higher the market value, the more compensation they earn.

When actual performance lags behind expectations, managers and owners may be tempted to manipulate accruals and deferrals to make up part of the difference. For example, managers may record cash received in advance of being earned as revenue in the current period or may fail to accrue certain expenses at year-end. Evidence from studies of large samples of companies indicates that some managers do engage in such fraudulent behavior. This research is borne out by enforcement actions, against companies and sometimes against their auditors, by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the independent, federal agency responsible for overseeing the fair functioning of the securities markets and for protecting investors. From 2015 through 2020, the SEC brought an annual average of over 800 enforcement actions against corporations and executives for reasons including financial reporting and disclosure issues. In 2020 alone, the SEC obtained over $\mathbb{S}4.5$ billion in monetary remedies for ill-gotten gains and penalties.\*  

In many of these cases, the firms involved, their managers, and their auditors are penalized for such actions. Furthermore, owners suffer because news of an SEC investigation negatively affects the company’s stock price.

## PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

As you learned in Chapter 1, the financial statements are interrelated—that is, the numbers from one statement flow into the next statement. Exhibit 4.4 highlights the interconnections among the statements using the fundamental accounting equation, followed by a summary structure of each statement demonstrating relationships.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 4-2  

Present an income statement with earnings per share, a statement of stockholders’ equity, and a balance sheet.  

## EXHIBIT 4.4  

![](images/81be8ab7c9a82cc6326188ecc36c79fa05d47f47a96ce18007bf7e89929054b1.jpg)  
Interrelationships of Financial Statements  

Another way of presenting the relationships among the statements follows.  

![](images/1334a370459da5f62f877d90c99a881c41855ec58ef3cba16caab4697549d9ca.jpg)  

(1)	The first statement to prepare is the Income Statement which reports that revenues minus expenses yields net income.  

(2)	Net income is a component in determining total stockholders’ equity. Net income (or net loss) and dividends declared to stockholders affect Retained Earnings and any additional issuances or repurchases of stock during the period affect the balances in Common Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital, all of which appear on the Statement of Stockholders’ Equity.   
(3)	Stockholders’ Equity is a component of the Balance Sheet.  

## Thus, if a number on the income statement changes or is in error, it will impact the other statements.  

Before we prepare a complete set of financial statements, let’s update Chipotle’s trial balance to reflect the adjustments assumed in this chapter, providing us with the adjusted balances needed for the statements. The spreadsheet in Exhibit 4.5 has three sets of debit-credit columns: one for the unadjusted balances from the T-accounts in Exhibit 3.6, then the effects of the adjustments AJE 1 through AJE 9, and finally, the adjusted balances that are determined by adding or subtracting the adjustment across each row. Again, we note that the total debits equal the total credits in each of the sets. Also notice that nearly every revenue and expense account was adjusted and several new accounts were created during the adjustment process at the end of the period (e.g., Interest Receivable and Depreciation Expense). It is from these adjusted balances that we will prepare an income statement, a statement of stockholders’ equity (which includes a column for Retained Earnings), and a balance sheet. Only Retained Earnings is yet to be updated with the effects of the adjustments on net income. It will be updated during the closing process discussed after financial statements are prepared and disseminated.  

## Income Statement  

The income statement is prepared first because net income is a component of Retained Earnings.

Microsoft Excel  

You will note that the earnings per share (EPS) ratio is reported on the income statement. It is widely used in evaluating the operating performance and profitability of a company, and it is the only ratio required to be disclosed on the statement or in the notes to the statements. The actual computation of the ratio is quite complex and appropriate for more advanced accounting courses. In this text, we simplify the earnings per share computation as:  

![](images/ce6b47568ed130dad07313b99d7adceb564fb93f835e5bc03c2b824fbfb01404.jpg)  
\*As you will learn in Chapter 11: (1) If there are preferred stock dividends, the amount is subtracted from net income in the numerator, (2) the denominator for weighted average shares is a complex computation, and (3) outstanding shares are those that are currently held by the shareholders.   
From transaction (a) in Ch. 2 From transaction (g) in Ch. 2 From the income statement From transaction (h) in Ch. 2 On the balance sheet  

The denominator in the EPS ratio is the weighted average number of shares outstanding (NOTE: Until Chapter 11, we compute a simple average—the number at the beginning of the period plus the number at the end of the period, divided by 2). For our Chipotle Mexican Grill illustration, the number of shares at the beginning of 2020 (end of 2019) was 100 million shares [computed by dividing the $\mathbb{S}1$ (in millions) Common Stock amount reported on the December 31, 2019, balance sheet in Exhibit 2.1 by the $\mathbb{S}0.01$ par value per share (listed next to Common Stock in Exhibit 2.1)]. During the first quarter of 2020, we illustrated an issuance of an additional 100 million shares for a total of 200 million shares at the end of the quarter. Therefore, the average number of shares outstanding was 150 million for the quarter [(Beg. $100+\mathrm{{End.}~200})/2=150$ average]. The quarterly EPS for Chipotle in our illustration is $\mathbb{S}0.39$ per share:  

$\mathrm{EPS}=\mathrm{\frac{\oint59~net~income~for~the~quarter}{150~a v e r a g e~n u m b e r~o f~s h a r e s~o u t s t a n d i n g}}=\S0.39$ for the quarter  

## Statement of Stockholders’ Equity  

The final total from the income statement, net income, is carried forward to the Retained Earnings column of the statement of stockholders’ equity. To this, the additional elements of the statement are added. Dividends declared and an additional stock issuance (from Chapter 2) also are included in the statement:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="5">CHIPOTLEMEXICAN GRILL,INC.

## Balance Sheet  

The ending balances for Common Stock, Additional Paid-in Capital, Treasury Stock, and Retained Earnings from the statement of stockholders’ equity are included on the balance sheet that follows. You will notice that the contra-asset account Accumulated Depreciation (used cost) has been subtracted from the total of the land, buildings, and equipment accounts (at cost) to reflect net book value (or carrying value) at period-end for balance sheet purposes. Also recall that assets are listed in order of liquidity and liabilities are listed in order of due dates. Current assets are those used or turned into cash within one year (as well as inventory). Current liabilities are obligations to be paid with current assets within one year. We present a comparative balance sheet that shows the amounts at two points in time: December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020.

## Cash Flows from Operations, Net Income, and the Quality of Earnings  

As presented in the previous chapters, the statement of cash flows explains the difference between the ending and beginning balances in the Cash account on the balance sheet during the accounting period. Put simply, the cash flow statement is a categorized list of all transactions of the period that affected the Cash account. The three categories are operating, investing, and financing activities. Because no adjustments made in this chapter affected cash, the cash flow categories identified on the Cash T-account at the end of Chapter 3 remain the same.  

Many standard financial analysis texts warn analysts to look for unusual deferrals and accruals when they attempt to predict future periods’ earnings. They often suggest that wide disparities between net income and cash flow from operations are a useful warning sign. For example, Subramanyan suggests the following:  

Accounting accruals determining net income rely on estimates, deferrals, allocations, and valuations. These considerations sometimes allow more subjectivity than do the factors determining cash flows. For this reason we often relate cash flows from operations to net income in assessing its quality. Some users consider earnings of higher quality when the ratio of cash flows from operations divided by net income is greater. This derives from a concern with revenue recognition or expense accrual criteria yielding high net income but low cash flows (emphasis added).\*  

The cash flows from operations to net income ratio is illustrated and discussed in more depth in Chapter 12.

## INTERPRETATIONS  

In General The total asset turnover ratio measures how efficient management is at using assets to generate sales. Over time or compared to competitors, the higher the asset turnover is, the more efficient assets are being utilized to generate revenues. A company’s products or services and business strategy contribute significantly to its asset turnover ratio. However, when competitors are similar, management’s ability to control the firm’s assets is vital in determining its success. Stronger financial performance improves the asset turnover ratio.  

Creditors and security analysts use this ratio to assess a company’s effectiveness at controlling both current and noncurrent assets. In a well-run business, creditors expect the ratio on a quarterly basis to fluctuate due to seasonal upswings and downturns. For example, as inventory is built up prior to a heavy sales season, companies need to borrow funds. The asset turnover ratio declines with this increase in assets. Eventually, the season’s high sales provide the cash needed to repay the loans. The asset turnover ratio then rises with the increased sales.  

Focus Company Analysis Chipotle’s total asset turnover ratio decreased from 2018 to 2019, primarily due to a reporting requirement change in 2019. The total assets in 2019 more than doubled because operating lease right-of-use assets (the majority of the Chipotle’s facilities) are now required to be included on the balance sheet in assets along with the lease liabilities. Previously, these were reported in the notes to the financial statements. If we exclude the leased assets from the 2019 total assets amount, then the ratio becomes 2.296. Using this revised ratio, asset turnover increased over time. This suggests that Chipotle’s management used assets more efficiently over time to generate operating revenues.  

Chipotle’s total asset turnover ratio is higher than that for both El Pollo Loco and Shake Shack in 2019. This is due in part to differences in business strategies. Chipotle has been one of the largest fastcasual and fastest-growing restaurant chains, and it is significantly larger (with over $\mathbb{S}5$ billion in total assets at the end of 2019) than its two competitors (each with under $\mathbb{S}1$ billion in total assets at the end of 2019). In addition, approximately 60 of El Pollo Loco restaurants are franchised and 12 percent of Shake Shack’s are licensed, whereas Chipotle’s restaurants are all company-owned. Also, Chipotle’s much larger size enhances its efficiency.  

A Few Cautions While the total asset turnover ratio may decrease due to seasonal fluctuations, a declining ratio also may be caused by changes in corporate policies leading to a rising level of assets. Examples include relaxing credit policies for new customers or reducing collection efforts in accounts receivable. And, as we noted above, a change in accounting and reporting requirements can also have an impact. A detailed analysis of the changes in the key components of assets and a review of the notes to the financial statements to identify accounting and reporting changes are needed to determine the causes of a change in the asset turnover ratio and thus management’s decisions.  

## DATA ANALYTICS  

## The SEC Uses Data Analytics  

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission formed the Financial Reporting and Audit (FRAud) Group under the Division of Enforcement, which concentrates on detecting fraud and prosecuting corporations and individuals for violations involving false or misleading financial statements and disclosures. The SEC uses data analytics to build a more proactive enforcement program. The FRAud Group relies on statistical modeling and other data tools, for example, to analyze narratives in financial statements submitted to the SEC by public corporations to identify subtle differences in the tone and language that provide quantifiable measures of risk (and potential fraud). Also, the Division’s Earnings Per Share Initiative uses risk-based data analytics to uncover potential accounting and disclosure violations often caused by earnings management practices to hide weak performances that were not expected.  

## Quick Closing Entry  

Revenue and gain accounts (R) are debited.   
Expense and loss accounts (E) are credited.   
Retained Earnings is credited if there is net income $(\mathsf{R}>\mathsf{E})$ or debited if there is net loss   
$(\mathsf{R}<\mathsf{E})$ for the difference:   
$\mathsf{R}-\mathsf{E}=$ net income or net loss.  

## CLOSING THE BOOKS  

## End of the Accounting Cycle  

As shown in the steps of the accounting cycle in Exhibit 4.1, all adjusting entries are recorded and posted to update the accounts and then the financial statements are prepared and disseminated to users. A closing process is needed as the last step in the accounting cycle to mark the end of the current period and the beginning of the next.  

First, before illustrating the process, notice special labels for the accounts in Exhibit 4.4:  

•	 Balance sheet accounts (assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity) are considered permanent accounts, indicating that they retain their balances from the end of one period to the beginning of the next. For example, Chipotle’s December 31, 2019 Cash balance of $\mathbb{S}481$ million is the beginning Cash balance of the first quarter of 2020. The only time a permanent account has a zero balance is when the item it represents is no longer owned or owed.   
•	 Income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, and losses accounts) are temporary accounts because their balances accumulate during a period to determine financial performance for the period. However, the accounts must start with a zero balance at the beginning of the next period to determine next period’s financial performance. For example, notice in the T-accounts for $A J E\,4$ that the three expense accounts begin with $\mathbb{S}0$ balances and accumulate amounts through the transaction. A process is needed to return these income statement accounts to a $\mathbb{S}0$ balance for the beginning of the next quarter.  

Another issue is that the Retained Earnings account balance is not correct until the closing process is complete. Retained Earnings increases with the period’s net income and decreases with dividends declared (and net losses) for the period. You can see in Chipotle’s Statement of Stockholders’ Equity on page 186 that Retained Earnings should have an ending balance of $\Phi2{,}973$ million. However, the trial balance spreadsheet in Exhibit 4.5 shows a balance for Retained Earnings of $\mathbb{S}2{,}914$ . The Retained Earnings T-account does not yet include the effects of net income. The closing process is needed to move net income (a subtotal) to Retained Earnings.  

The final step in the accounting cycle, closing the books, is done by recording a closing journal entry and posting the effects to the appropriate accounts. A closing entry has two purposes:  

1.	To transfer the balances in the temporary accounts (income statement accounts) to Retained Earnings.   
2.	To establish a zero balance in each of the temporary accounts to start the accumulation in the next accounting period.  

The closing entry is dated the last day of the accounting period, entered in the usual debitsequal-credits format (in the journal), and immediately posted to the ledger (or T-accounts). The income statement (temporary) accounts with debit balances are credited and the income statement (temporary) accounts with credit balances are debited. The net amount, equal to net income, affects Retained Earnings.  

To illustrate the process, we create an example using just a few accounts. Assume Ashley Company had the following partial adjusted trial balance and related T-accounts:  

![](images/725fba9d2f18f61992550f84b97e262178fe4cec9158d42e66f5e92340a8ce16.jpg)  

Follow the examples from (1) the trial balance to (2) the closing entry to (3) the postings to the T-accounts:  

•	 Every revenue account (with a credit balance) was debited to make the ending balances $\mathbb{S}0$ (e.g., see the green arrow example) .   
•	 Every expense and loss account (with a debit balance) was credited to make the ending balances $\mathbb{S}0$ (e.g., see the red arrow example).   
•	 The revenues and expenses were “closed” (zeroed out by moving the balances) to Retained Earnings – equal to net income of $\mathbb{S}90$ .  This is also the number that makes the debits equal to the credits (see the blue arrow).  

We will now prepare the closing entry (CE) for Chipotle at March 31, 2020, although companies close their records usually only at the end of the fiscal year. These amounts are taken from the adjusted trial balance spreadsheet in Exhibit 4.5. The effects on the accounting equation and the posting of the effects to the income statement and Retained Earnings T-accounts follow the closing entry. Notice that the $\mathbb{S}59$ increase in Retained Earnings equals net income and all income statement accounts have $\mathbb{S}0$ balances.

## Tip  

Most companies use computerized accounting applications (from desktop to cloudbased packages) to record journal entries, produce trial balances and financial statements, and close the books. As an example, for small- to medium-sized businesses, QuickBooks® is a popular accounting software package that offers advanced and cloud capabilities.

## Beginning balances are from the adjusted trial balance in Exhibit 4.5:  

![](images/380762d33f0f82253a58dce68e69d1e6084c6a40b6e677de45471c872b8bb366.jpg)  

## P A U S E  F O R F E E D B A C K  

The process of closing the books (after adjustments) includes making all temporary account balances (from the income statement) zero and transferring the difference (net income) to Retained Earnings.  

The following is an adjusted trial balance from a recent year for Mattel, Inc. (designer, manufacturer, and marketer of popular toys including American Girl and Barbie dolls, Fisher-Price toys, and Hot Wheels). Record the closing journal entry at the end of the accounting cycle to close the books for Mattel.

## Post-Closing Trial Balance  

As an additional step of the accounting information processing cycle, a post-closing trial balance should be prepared as a check that debits still equal credits and that all temporary accounts have been closed. It would have the structure of the trial balance shown in Exhibit 4.5 with only balance sheet accounts having balances. The income statement accounts should be $\mathbb{S}0$ . The accounting cycle for the period is now complete.

4-1.	 Explain the purpose of adjustments and analyze the adjustments necessary at the end of the period to update revenues and expenses and related balance sheet accounts. p. 172  

•	 Adjusting entries are necessary at the end of the accounting period to measure income properly, correct errors, and provide for adequate valuation of balance sheet accounts. These are the types:  

Deferrals: •	 Revenue earned and cash received in the past (recorded as a liability)—Increase revenue, decrease liability •	 Expense incurred and cash paid in the past (recorded as an asset)—Increase expense, decrease asset Accruals: •	 Revenue earned and cash to be received in the future (not yet recorded)—Increase revenue, increase asset (receivable) •	 Expense incurred and cash to be paid in the future (not yet recorded)—Increase expense, increase liability (payable) •	 Recording adjusting entries has no effect on the Cash account.  

4-2.	 Present an income statement with earnings per share, a statement of stockholders’ equity, and a balance sheet. p. 183  

Adjusted account balances are used in preparing the following financial statements:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Incomes Statement: Operatingrevenues -Operatingexpenses</td></tr><tr><td>Operatingincome(orloss) +/-Other items</td></tr><tr><td>Pretaxincome -Incometaxexpense</td></tr><tr><td>Netincome</td></tr><tr><td>Earningspershare</td></tr></table></body></html>

−Beg. Treasury stock $^+$ New stock repurchases Beg. Retained Earnings $^+$ Net income − Dividends declared   
Ending stockholders’ equity  

## 4-3.	 Compute and interpret the total asset turnover ratio. p. 188  

The total asset turnover ratio (Net Sales (or Operating Revenues) $\div$ Average Total Assets) measures sales generated per dollar of assets. A rising total asset turnover signals more efficient management of assets.  

4-4.	 Explain the closing process. p. 190  

Temporary accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, and losses) are closed to a zero balance at the end of the accounting period to allow for the accumulation of income statement items in the following period and to update Retained Earnings for the period’s net income. To close these accounts, debit each revenue and gain account, credit each expense and loss account, and record the difference (equal to net income) to Retained Earnings.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>(CE) Each revenue (-R,-SE)</td><td></td><td>XX</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Each gain (-R,-SE)</td><td></td><td>XX</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Each expense (-E, +SE)</td><td></td><td>XX</td></tr><tr><td>Each loss (-E,+SE)</td><td></td><td></td><td>XX</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Retainedearnings(+SE)*</td><td></td><td>XX</td></tr></table></body></html>  

This chapter discussed the important steps in the accounting cycle that take place at year-end. These include the adjustment process, the preparation of the basic financial statements, and the closing process that prepares the records for the next accounting period. This end to the internal portions of the accounting cycle, however, is just the beginning of the process of communicating accounting information to external users.  

In the next chapter, we take a closer look at more sophisticated financial statements and related disclosures. We also examine the process by which financial information is disseminated to professional analysts, investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the public, and the role each plays in analyzing and interpreting the information. These discussions will help you consolidate much of what you have learned about the financial reporting process from previous chapters. It also will preview many of the important issues we address in later chapters. These later chapters include many other adjustments that involve difficult and complex estimates about the future, such as estimates of customers’ ability to make payments to the company for purchases on account, the useful lives of new machines, and future amounts that a company may owe on warranties of products sold in the past. Each of these estimates and many others can have significant effects on the stream of net earnings that companies report over time.  

Total asset turnover measures the sales generated per dollar of assets. A high or rising ratio suggests that the company is managing its assets more efficiently. It is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analy sis” box in the Preparing Financial Statements section) (p. 188):  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Currentassets Noncurrentassets</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Totalassets Currentliabilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Noncurrentliabilities</td><td>Stockholders'equity</td></tr><tr><td>Total liabilities and stockholders' equity</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

The credit to Retained Earnings assumes net income is positive. If the total of expenses/losses exceeds the total of revenues/gains, Retained Earnings would be debited (reduced) for the amount of the net loss.

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">IncomeStatement</td></tr><tr><td>Rentrevenue</td><td>$109,000</td></tr><tr><td>Expenses:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Salariesandwagesexpense</td><td>26,500</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenanceexpense</td><td>12,000</td></tr><tr><td>Rent expense</td><td>8,800</td></tr><tr><td>Utilities expense</td><td>4,300</td></tr><tr><td>Gasandoilexpense</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>Miscellaneous expenses (items not listed elsewhere)</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total expenses</td><td>55,600</td></tr><tr><td>Income</td><td>$ 53,400</td></tr></table></body></html>  

You are an independent CPA hired by the company to audit the company’s accounting systems and review the financial statements. In your audit, you developed additional data as follows:  

a.	 Salaries and wages for the last three days of December amounting to $\mathbb{S}730$ were not recorded or paid. $\boldsymbol{b}$ .	 Jay estimated telephone usage at $\mathbb{S}440$ for December, but nothing has been recorded or paid. c.	 Depreciation on rental autos, amounting to $\mathbb{S}24{,}000$ for the current year, was not recorded. d.	 Interest on a $\mathbb{S}15{,}000$ , one-year, 8 percent note payable dated October 1 of the current year was not recorded. The 8 percent interest is payable on the maturity date of the note. e.	 Maintenance expense excludes \$1,100, representing the cost of maintenance supplies used during the current year. f.	 The Unearned Rent Revenue account includes $\mathbb{S}4\mathrm{,}100$ of revenue to be earned in January of next year. g.	 The income tax expense is $\Phi5{,}800$ . Payment of income tax will be made next year.  

## Required:  

1.	 For items $(a)$ through $(g)$ , what adjusting entry should Jay record at December 31? If none is required, explain why.   
2.	 Prepare a corrected income statement for the current year in good (with subheadings for income from Operations and Other Item), including earnings per share (rounded to two decimal places). Assume that 7,000 shares of stock are outstanding all year. Show computations.   
3.	 Assume the beginning-of-the-year balance for Jay’s total assets was $^{\S58,020}$ and its ending balance for total assets was $\mathbb{S}65{,}180$ . Compute the total asset turnover ratio (rounded to two decimal places) based on the corrected information. What does this ratio suggest? If the average total asset turnover ratio for the industry is 2.31, what might you infer about Jay, Inc.?

2.	 Compared to each other, is the management of these two companies more or less effective at utilizing assets to generate sales?  

$a$ .	 Target’s management is less effective than Walmart’s management at utilizing assets to generate sales.   
$b$ .	 Target’s management is less effective at controlling expenses than Walmart’s management.   
$c$ .	 Both companies’ ratios suggest that their management teams are each likely to generate revenues with current assets.   
d.	 Target’s management is doing poorly.

## Using Financial Reports: Analyzing Financial Information in a Sale of a Business (Challenging)  

Lisa Knight owns and operates Lisa’s Day Spa and Salon, Inc. She has decided to sell the business and retire, and is in discussions with Helen Bailey, the owner of a regional chain of day spas. The discussions are at the complex stage of agreeing on a price. Among the important factors have been the financial statements of the business. Lisa’s secretary, Alisha, under Lisa’s direction, maintained the records. Each year they developed a statement of profits on a cash basis; no balance sheet was prepared. Upon request, Lisa provided the Helen with the following statement for 2023 prepared by Alisha:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>LISA'SDAYSPAANDSALON,INC StatementofProfits2023</td></tr><tr><td>Spa fees collected $1,215,000 Expenses paid: Rentfor office space $130,000 Utilities expense 43,600 Telephone expense 12,200 Salaries expense 562,000 Supplies expense 31,900 Miscellaneousexpenses 12,400 Total expenses 792,100 Profit for the year 422,900</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Upon agreement of the parties, you have been asked to examine the financial figures for 2023. Helen said, “I question the figures because, among other things, they appear to be on a 100 percent cash basis.” Your investigations revealed the following additional data at December 31, 2023:  

a.	 Of the $^{\S1,215,000}$ in spa fees collected in 2023, $^{\S142,000}$ was for services performed prior to 2023.   
$\boldsymbol{b}$ .	 At the end of 2023, spa fees of $\mathbb{\Omega}29{,}000$ for services performed during the year were uncollected.   
c.	 Office equipment owned and used by Lisa cost $\mathbb{S}205{,}000$ . Depreciation was estimated at $\mathbb{S}20{,}500$ annually.   
d.	 A count of supplies at December 31, 2023, reflected $\mathbb{S}5{,}200$ worth of items purchased during the year that were still on hand. Also, the records for 2022 indicated that the supplies on hand at the end of that year were $\mathbb{S}3{,}125$ .   
e.	 At the end of 2023, the secretary whose salary is $\mathbb{S}24{,}000$ per year had not been paid for December because of a long trip that extended to January 15, 2024.   
$|f_{\cdot}\rrangle$ The December 2023 telephone bill for $\mathbb{S}1{,}400$ has not been recorded or paid. In addition, the $\mathbb{S}12{,}200$ amount on the statement of profits includes payment of the December 2022 bill of $\mathbb{S}1{,}800$ in January 2023.  

g.	 The $\mathbb{S}130{,}000$ office rent paid was for 13 months (it included the rent for January 2024).  

Required:  

1.	 On the basis of this information, prepare a corrected income statement for 2023 (ignore income taxes). Show your computations for any amounts changed from those in the statement prepared by Lisa’s secretary. (Suggestion: Format solution with four column headings: Items; Cash Basis per Lisa’s Statement, $\mathfrak{S}$ ; Explanation of Changes; and Corrected Basis, $\Phi.$ )   
2.	 Write a memo to Lisa Knight and Helen Bailey to support your schedule prepared in requirement (1). The purpose should be to explain the reasons for your changes and to suggest other important items that should be considered in the pricing decision.

After briefly reviewing the statements and “looking into the situation,” you requested that the statements be redone (with some expert help) to “incorporate depreciation, accruals, inventory counts, income taxes, and so on.” As a result of a review of the records and supporting documents, the following additional information was developed:  

a.	 The Supplies of $\mathbb{S}4\mathrm{,}000$ shown on the balance sheet has not been adjusted for supplies used during 2024. A count of the supplies on hand on December 31, 2024, showed $\mathbb{S}1\!,\!800$ worth of supplies remaining.   
b.	 The insurance premium paid in 2024 was for years 2024 and 2025. The total insurance premium was debited in full to Prepaid Insurance when paid in 2024 and no adjustment has been made.   
c.	 The equipment cost $^{\S40,000}$ when purchased January 1, 2024. It has an estimated annual depreciation of $\Phi8{,}000$ . No depreciation has been recorded for 2024.   
d.	 Unpaid (and unrecorded) salaries at December 31, 2024, amounted to $\mathbb{S}3{,}200$ .   
e.	 At December 31, 2024, transportation revenue collected in advance amounted to $\mathbb{S}7{,}000$ . This amount was credited in full to Transportation Revenue when the cash was collected earlier during 2024.   
f.	 The income tax rate is 25 percent.  

1.	 Record the six adjusting entries required on December 31, 2024, based on the preceding additional information.  

2.	 Recast the preceding statements after taking into account the adjusting entries. You do not need to use classifications on the statements. Suggested form for the solution:  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Items</td><td rowspan="2">Amounts</td><td colspan="2">CHANGES</td><td rowspan="2">Corrected Amounts</td></tr><tr><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>(List here each item from the twostatements)</td><td>Reported</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

3.	 Omission of the adjusting entries caused: a.	 Net income to be overstated or understated (select one) by $\mathbb{S}_{.}$ $b$ .	 Total assets on the balance sheet to be overstated or understated (select one) by $\mathbb{S}_{.}$ c.	 Total liabilities on the balance sheet to be overstated or understated (select one) by $\mathfrak{S}_{.}$   
4.	 For both the unadjusted and adjusted balances, calculate these ratios for the company: $(a)$ earnings per share (rounded to two decimal places) and $(b)$ total asset turnover (rounded to three decimal places), assuming the correct amount of total assets at the beginning of the year was $^{\mathbb{S}46,400}$ . There were 10,000 shares outstanding all year. Explain the causes of the differences and the impact of the changes on financial analysis.   
5.	 Write a letter to the company explaining the results of the adjustments, your analysis, and your decision regarding the loan.
