# Ch03 Operating Decisions and the Accounting System

hipotle Mexican Grill keeps operations simple, offering a few menu items (­burritos, burrito bowls, tacos, and salads). Within these items, customers can choose from a variety of meats, tofu, veggies beans, rice, and additional items such as salsa, guacamole, cheese, lettuce, and queso—creating hundreds of options. The focused menu allows Chipotle to concentrate on the source of the food items, a challenging activity given the smaller and often costlier market for organic meats, ­produce, and dairy products. Anticipating changes in these food costs and sources is critical to determining menu prices and controlling costs.  

To control quality and increase efficiency, the company purchases key ingredients such as meat, beans, rice, cheese, and tortillas from a small number of suppliers and other raw materials from approved sources. Twenty-three independently owned and operated regional distribution centers purchase from these suppliers and then deliver the items as needed to the Chipotle restaurants in each region. To ensure food safety, Chipotle provides training for local farmers, utilizes advanced technology to trace the source of the food from suppliers to the restaurants, uses the sous vide (slow-cooking in hot water bath) method to control any pathogens or bacteria in meat, and provides bonuses to crew teams who meet specific food safety goals, among other measures. The second highest cost for Chipotle, as with most restaurants, is hiring and developing its over 91,000 employees. The food is prepared from scratch on stoves and grills, not with microwaves and other automated cooking techniques. Each employee

is cross-trained in all aspects of preparing the food—from grilling, to making fresh salsa and guacamole, to cooking rice—and creating a positive interactive experience for customers. The company has a strong culture of employee professional and personal development with numerous incentives to build and retain strong leadership. ­Chipotle’s Cultivate Education program provides tuition reimbursement and has a ­Debt-Free Degree program at selected colleges, including Paul Quinn College, one of the oldest historically black colleges in the country. These programs contribute to retention, with about 80 percent of its general managers promoted from within Chipotle.  

Chipotle also competes using marketing strategies. In 2018, Chipotle began to utilize more aggressive marketing efforts, including “addressable TV” ads (targeting selective segments of on-demand or live TV shows), digital marketing, online ordering, and a loyalty program. Having these initiatives in place allowed Chipotle to respond rapidly to the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in a surge in on-line ordering and deliveries.

Learn more about Chipotle from founder, Steve Ells, by listening to the NPR podcast Chipotle: Steve Ells: How I Built This. How I Built This NPR podcasts are about innovators, entrepreneurs, idealists, and the movements they built.  

Over Chipotle’s history since 1993, the restaurant industry has become extremely competitive with many established as well as new concept restaurants adopting service and sourcing formats similar to Chipotle’s. For example, in 2012, McDonald’s ­Corporation announced a requirement that suppliers need to phase out stalls that restrict the movement of pregnant pigs, a change made in direct response to Chipotle’s TV video on its ethical stance aired at the Grammy Awards. Taco Bell created its urban Taco Bell ­Cantina model with a menu featuring “gourmet” food items. Jack in the Box, Inc., expanded its Qdoba Mexican Grill chain to compete in the fast-casual segment of the restaurant industry. The newer concepts feature Mediterranean, Indian, farm-to-table, fish-to-table, and vegetarian cuisine, with many more popping up every day that focus on selective food sourcing, food prepared on-site, and a service model that allows customers to choose exactly what they want to eat. For example, the fast-growing,

## chipotle.com  

fast-casual concepts include City Barbecue offering smoked in-house meats and sides, Sweetgreen with seasonal salads and grain bowls, and Bibibop Asian Grill with Korean flavors using healthy ingredients.  

Restaurants have to manage economic downturns and shifts in consumer tastes for healthier food choices while facing the competition. The Covid-19 pandemic, for example, created tremendous upheaval in the restaurant industry. To respond, most of the fast-casual restaurants began offering drive-through or curbside pick-up, digital ordering, and delivery service, supported by digital technology. Based on their projections of these forces, companies set goals for their performance. Published income statements provide the primary basis for comparing projections to the actual results of operations. To understand how business plans and the results of operations are reflected on the income statement, we need to answer the following questions:  

1.	 How do business activities affect the income statement?   
2.	 How are business activities measured?   
3.	 How are business activities reported on the income statement?  

In Chapter 2, we illustrated the use of transaction analysis, journal entries, and T-accounts for investing and financing activities. In this chapter, we apply these tools for operating activities, as illustrated with hypothetical quarterly transactions for Chipotle that involve the sale of food to the public. The results of these activities are reported on the income statement.

ORGANIZATION OF THE CHAPTER  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 3-  

Describe a typical business operating cycle and explain the necessity for the time period assumption.  

## HOW DO BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE INCOME STATEMENT?  

## The Operating Cycle  

The long-term objective for any business is to turn cash into more cash. If a company is to stay in business, this excess cash must be generated from operations (that is, from the activities for which the business was established), not from borrowing money or selling long-lived assets.  

Companies (1) acquire inventory and the services of employees and (2) sell inventory or ­services to customers. The operating (cash-to-cash) cycle begins when a company receives goods to sell, then continues when the company pays for them and sells the goods to customers (or, in the case of a service company, has employees work to provide services to customers). It ends when customers pay cash to the company. The length of time for completion of the operating cycle depends on the nature of the business.  

![](images/0c2ee384134ec0dc7ba108f39bb6f88fdd60a05a5bd18a3de35c19a6ad30c436.jpg)

The operating cycle for Chipotle is relatively short. It spends cash to purchase fresh ingredients, prepares the food, and sells it to customers for cash. In some companies, inventory is paid for well before it is sold. Amazon.com, for example, builds its inventory for months preceding the year-end holiday season. It may borrow funds from banks to pay for the inventory, and then it repays the loans with interest when it receives cash from customers. In other companies, cash is received from customers well after a sale takes place. For example, furniture retailers such as Ethan Allen often allow customers to make monthly payments over several years. Shortening the operating cycle by creating incentives that encourage customers to buy sooner and/or pay faster improves a company’s cash flows.  

Until a company ceases its activities, the operating cycle is repeated continuously. However, decision makers require information periodically about the company’s financial condition and performance. To measure income for a specific period of time, accountants follow the time period assumption, which assumes that the long life of a company can be reported in shorter time periods, such as months, quarters, and years.1 Two types of issues arise in reporting periodic income to users:  

1.	Recognition issues: When should the effects of operating activities be recognized (recorded)?  

2.	Measurement issues: What amounts should be recognized?  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 3-2  

Explain how business activities affect the elements of the income statement.  

Before we examine the rules accountants follow in resolving these issues, however, let’s examine the elements of the income statement that are affected by operating activities.  

## Elements of the Income Statement  

Exhibit 3.1 shows a recent income statement for Chipotle, simplified for the purposes of this chapter. It has multiple subtotals, such as income from operations and income before income taxes. This format is known as multiple step and is very common.2 In fact, you can tell if a company uses the multiple-step format if you see the Income from Operations subtotal (also called Operating Income).  

## Operating Activities  

Revenues are the amounts earned and recorded from a company’s day-to-day business activities, mostly when a company sells products or provides services to customers or clients (the central

2Another common format, single step, reorganizes all accounts from the multiple-step format. All revenues and gains are listed together and all expenses and losses except taxes are listed together. The expense subtotal is then subtracted from the revenue subtotal to arrive at income before income taxes, the same subtotal as on the multiple-step statement. In the single-step format, there is no subtotal for income from operations or a separate section for other items.  

focus of the business). When Chipotle sells salad bowls to consumers, it has earned revenue. When revenue is earned, usually Cash or Accounts Receivable (amounts due from customers) increases. Sometimes if a customer pays for goods or services in advance, for example, when buying a Chipotle gift card, the company creates a liability account, usually Unearned (or Deferred) Revenue. At this point, no revenue has been earned. There is simply a receipt of cash in exchange for a promise to provide a good or service in the future. Later, when the company provides the promised goods or services to the customer paying with the gift card, then the revenue is recognized and the liability is eliminated.  

Many companies generate revenues from a variety of sources. For example, General Motors reports revenues from its automotive sales as well as from providing financing to customers. In the restaurant industry, many companies, such as McDonald’s Corporation, have companyowned stores but also sell franchise rights. The franchisor (seller) reports revenues from both the sales of food in company-owned stores and the fees from franchisees. Chipotle does not sell franchises. Therefore, the company generates revenue from one source—sales of food orders to customers—that is reported in the Restaurant Sales Revenue account.  

Expenses are the costs of operating the business that are incurred to generate revenues during the period. Usually, many expenses are incurred (that is, the resources or services of others that are used) in making a sale or providing a service. When Chipotle’s employees prepare and serve food to customers, Chipotle incurs an expense for using employee labor to generate revenue. The company uses electric service to operate equipment and light its facilities, and it uses food and paper supplies. Without incurring these expenses, Chipotle could not generate revenues. Expenses may be incurred before, after, or at the same time as they are paid in cash. When an expense is incurred, assets such as Supplies decrease (are used up) or liabilities such as Wages Payable or Utilities Payable increase. The following are Chipotle’s primary expenses:  

## Restaurant Operating Expenses:  

Supplies Expense. In Chipotle’s restaurant operations, any food ingredients or beverage and packaging supplies that are used to produce and sell meals are expensed as they are used. For Chipotle, this is its largest expense at $\mathbb{S}1{,}848$ million in 2019. In companies with a manufacturing or merchandising focus, the most significant expense is usually Cost of Sales (or Cost of Goods Sold), representing the cost of inventory used in generating sales.  

Wages Expense. When salaried and hourly employees work and generate sales for Chipotle, the company incurs an expense, although wages and salaries will be paid later. Wages Expense of $\mathbb{S}1{,}472$ million is Chipotle’s second largest expense. In purely service-oriented companies in which no products are produced or sold, the cost of having employees generate revenues is usually the largest expense. For example,  

­Federal Express reported over $\mathbb{S}25{,}031$ million in salaries expense for the year ended May 31, 2020.  

•	 Rent Expense, Insurance Expense, Utilities Expense, and Repairs Expense. Renting facilities, insuring property and equipment at the stores, using utilities, and repairing and maintaining facilities and equipment are typical expenses related to operating stores. Usually, rent and insurance are paid before occupying the facilities, but utilities and repairs are paid after occupying the facilities.  

Other Operating Expenses. These expenses include a wide variety of accounts with smaller dollar balances.  

General and Administrative Expenses: General and Administrative Expenses include costs of training employees and managers, advertising, and other expenses not directly related to operating stores. These often include expenses such as renting headquarters facilities and paying executive salaries.  

Depreciation Expense: When a company uses buildings and equipment to generate revenues, a part of the cost of these assets is reported as an expense called Depreciation Expense. Chapter 8 discusses methods for estimating the amount of depreciation expense.  

Some students con  

fuse the terms expenditure and expense. An expenditure is an outlay of cash for any purpose— including to buy equipment, pay off a bank loan, and pay for equipment repair. Not all expenditures are for expenses. Expenses, on the other hand, are costs incurred to generate revenue during the period— most expenses are not paid in cash when incurred.  

![](images/e53cbf29e1e46b4e45cd4ed69c5c9c3150c0409ddd7c92f7d15b8f8a1ca8999d.jpg)  

Tip Note that selling short- or long-term investments above or   
below cost also results in   
gains or losses, but these are   
reported in the Other Items   
section of the multiple-step   
income ­statement (they are   
not ­operating activities).  

Losses (Gains) on Disposal of Assets: Companies sell property, plant, and equipment from time to time to maintain modern facilities. When assets other than investments are sold or disposed of for more than their cost minus the amount of cost depreciated in the past, gains result. If they are sold or disposed of for less than their cost minus the amount of cost depreciated in the past, losses result. In 2019, Chipotle reported a loss on disposal of assets of $\mathbb{S}23$ million.  

Revenues minus expenses from operating activities equals Income from Operations (also called Operating Income)—a measure of the profit from central ongoing operations.  

## Other Items  

Not all activities affecting an income statement are central to ongoing operations. Any revenues, expenses, gains, or losses that result from these other activities are not included as part of income from operations but are instead categorized as Other Items. Typically, these include the following:  

•	 Interest Revenue (also Investment Revenue, Investment Income, or Dividend Revenue). Using excess cash to purchase stocks or bonds in other companies is not a part of Chipotle’s central operation of making and selling fresh Mexican food. Therefore, any interest or dividends earned on investments in other companies is not included as operating revenue.  

•	 Interest Expense. Likewise, for most businesses, borrowing money is not central to ongoing operations. Thus, the cost of using that money (called interest) is not an operating expense. Financial institutions such as banks are the exception where incurring interest expense and earning interest revenue are central to their operations.  

•	 Losses (Gains) on Sale of Investments. When investments are sold for less (or more) than the original cost, a loss (or gain) results and is reported as an Other Item on the income statement. In 2019, Chipotle did not report any gain or loss from selling investments.  

## Income Tax Expense  

Operating expenses are subtracted from operating revenues to determine Income before Income Taxes (also called Pretax Income). From this subtotal, Income Tax Expense (also called Provision for Income Taxes) is calculated by applying the tax rates of the federal, state, local, and foreign taxing authorities. Chipotle’s effective tax rate in 2019 was 23.6 percent $\mathbb{S}108$ million in income tax expense divided by $\mathbb{S}458$ million in income before income taxes). This indicates that, for every dollar of income before taxes that Chipotle made in 2019, the company paid nearly $\mathfrak{s}0.24$ to taxing authorities.  

## Earnings per Share  

Corporations are required to disclose earnings per share on the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements. This ratio is widely used in evaluating the operating performance and profitability of a company. At this introductory level, we can compute earnings per share simply as:  

![](images/41c6920ea368d61daacb308ac3ca81a6e059123ad58b1c690b35c33815488dc0.jpg)  

\*As you will learn in Chapter 11: (1) If there are preferred stock dividends, the amount is subtracted from net income in the numerator, (2) the denominator for weighted average shares is a complex computation, and (3) outstanding shares are those that are currently held by the shareholders.  

Please note, however, that the calculation of the ratio is actually much more complex and beyond the scope of this course. For simplicity, we use the $\mathbb{S}350$ million net income in Exhibit 3.1 as the numerator and approximately 27.74 million weighted average number of shares as computed by Chipotle for the denominator. For 2019, Chipotle reported $\mathbb{S}12.62$ in earnings for each share of stock owned by investors.  

## Using Data Analytics in the Restaurant Industry to Increase Revenues and Decrease Costs  

Restaurants are using a variety of technologies including kiosks, mobile apps, and tableside tablets from which ordering data can be mined to analyze purchasing profiles. Data analytics also facilitates monitoring employee performance, improving scheduling, boosting customer loyalty, and maximizing marketing efficiency. Here are a few examples of restaurants that use data analytics to optimize performance, make better and faster decisions, reduce costs, and improve the customer experience:  

Panera Bread was one of the first restaurants to install ordering kiosks to (1) encourage menu browsing, (2) capture customer preferences, (3) fine-tune the menu based on preferences, (4) produce shorter lines for a better customer experience, (5) ensure better order accuracy to improve operational efficiency and reduce waste, and (6) save and/or redeploy labor costs.  

McDonald’s uses data to predict customer demand in drive-thru sales. By ensuring adequate staffing and alerting staff to the spike in demand, the efficiency of operations is improved along with enhancing the customer experience.  

Wendy’s analyzes big data on past sales and customer demographics to identify the most profitable new restaurant locations.  

•	 Pizza Hut uses software to track customer eye movements on digital, interactive menus in some of its restaurants to discover what customers subconsciously want.  

Dunkin’ mines data from its mobile loyalty program called DD Perks to send customers targeted offers at specific times.

## HOW ARE OPERATING ACTIVITIES RECOGNIZEDAND MEASURED?  

There is more than one way to recognize and measure operating activities. Many sole proprietors and small partnerships, such as dental and doctors’ offices, choose to use the cash basis accounting method3 to determine performance. It is simple and is permitted for tax purposes. With cash basis accounting, owners record each transaction as money changes hands—paying a vendor in cash is a cash outflow and receiving cash from a customer or client is a cash inflow. This basis produces net cash flow information that is often quite adequate for organizations that do not need to report to external users.  

Using cash basis accounting may lead to an incorrect interpretation of company performance and financial position:  

•	 Revenues and expenses are often postponed or accelerated long before or after goods and service are delivered, and  

![](images/ed3cbc8a3b4ca98dddc87e8268a9d143cceb43b4f0df35c4eb2a6074d6b5b251.jpg)  

•	 Other than cash, assets and liabilities of the company are not reported in financial statements.  

For these reasons, cash basis financial statements are not very useful to external decision makers. Therefore, generally accepted accounting principles require accrual basis accounting fo financial reporting.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 3-3  

Explain the accrual basis of accounting and apply the revenue and expense recognition principles to measure income.  

## Accrual Accounting, in short:  

Recognize Revenues when EARNED (performed, delivered) Recognize Expenses when INCURRED (resources used or debts incurred) to generate revenues in the same period  

## Accrual Accounting  

In accrual basis accounting, revenues are recognized when goods and services are provided to customers (they are earned), and expenses are recognized in the same period as the revenues to which they relate (resources are used or debts are incurred to generate revenues), regardless of when cash is received or paid. The two basic accounting principles that determine when revenues and expenses are recorded under accrual basis accounting are the revenue recognition principle and the expense recognition principle (also called the matching principle).  

## Revenue Recognition Principle  

The core revenue recognition principle specifies both the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized during an accounting period. It requires that a company recognize revenue (1) when the company transfers promised goods or services to customers (2) in the amount it expects to be entitled to receive. The five steps to follow for recognizing revenue, especially when a sales contract is more complex,4 are:  

Step 1.	 Identify the contract (written, verbal, or implied agreement) between the company and customer.  

Example: A contract is created when Chipotle agrees to sell you a sofritas burrito.  

## Step 2.	 Identify the seller’s performance obligations (promised goods and services).  

Example: Some contracts involve one performance obligation—to deliver a sofritas burrito. However, other contracts include multiple obligations. Apple Inc. has identified up to three performance obligations involving the sale of certain products such as the iPhone: (1) to deliver the iPhone and its software; (2) to provide product-related bundled services including iCloud, Siri, and Maps; and (3) to provide future unspecified software upgrades for the iPhone.  

Step 3.	 Determine the transaction price (the amount the seller expects to be entitled to receive from the customer).  

Example: For Chipotle, the transaction price is the amount shown on the menu minus any discounts, coupons, and loyalty program awards— $^{\bullet9}$ from the Chipotle customer, for example. For Apple, the transaction price is the total price for the iPhone to be paid by the customer— $\mathbb{-S}750$ , for example.  

## Step 4.	 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.  

Example: For a single performance obligation, the full price relates to the delivery to the customer. However, when Apple sells (1) an iPhone, (2) product-related bundled services, and (3) a promise to provide future software upgrades, the transaction price is split among the three obligations by referring to the prices of each part sold separately.  

Step 5.	 Recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied (or over time if a service is ­provided over time).  

Example: Chipotle recognizes revenue upon delivery of the burrito to the customer. Apple will recognize as revenue a substantial portion of the allocated transaction price of the iPhone itself when it is delivered. Then, it will recognize a portion of the second and third obligations as they are provided to customers.  

For most contracts discussed in this text, the revenue recognition steps are easy to apply. For example, Chipotle (1) agrees to (2) deliver a burrito that has been ordered by a customer for (3) the menu price with (4) the entire menu price (5) recognized on delivery of the burrito to the customer. The critical point for revenue recognition under the five-step model is when goods or services are delivered, not when cash is received from customers. Cash may be received before, after, or at the time of delivery as illustrated in Exhibit 3.2. Let’s see how to handle each of these cases.  

![](images/fef7180e8d5e1b523c0734c4d9ee914cc0c17c9ffeaabd48880832728c90d72e.jpg)  

1	 Cash is received before the goods or services are delivered. Chipotle sells gift cards to customers for cash in exchange for the promise to provide future food orders. Because Chipotle has not delivered food at that point, it records no revenue. Instead, it creates a liability account called Unearned Revenue (or Deferred Revenue), representing the amount of food service owed to the customers. Later, when customers redeem their gift cards and Chipotle delivers the food, it earns and records the revenue while reducing the liability account because it has satisfied its promise to deliver.  

Cash is received in the same period as the goods or services are delivered. As is a typical timing of cash receipts and revenue recognition in the restaurant industry, Chipotle receives cash from most customers within a few minutes of them receiving their food. Chipotle delivers the food to the customer as ordered in exchange for cash, earning revenue in the process.  

3	 Cash is received after the goods or services are delivered. When a business sells goods or services on account (creating Accounts Receivable due from customers), the revenue is earned when the goods or services are delivered, not when cash is received at a later date. Let’s assume that, to boost business, Chipotle agrees to deliver food ordered by select customers, such as departments at area colleges or local businesses. These customers pay for the food order when Chipotle bills them at the end of the month, rather than when they receive the food. When delivered, Chipotle records both Restaurant Sales Revenue and the asset Accounts Receivable, representing the customer’s promise to pay in the future for past food deliveries. When the customer pays its monthly bill, Chipotle will increase its Cash account and decrease the asset Accounts Receivable.  

Companies usually disclose their revenue recognition practices in the financial statement note titled Significant Accounting Policies or in a separate note. The following excerpt from Note 1 to recent financial statements describes how Chipotle recognizes its revenue:

## P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K  

We just learned the revenue recognition principle’s criteria: Recognize revenue (1) when the company transfers promised goods or services to customers (2) in the amount it expects to be entitled to receive. Regardless of when cash is paid by customers, revenue is recognized upon delivery (satisfaction of performance obligations).

## Expense Recognition Principle  

The expense recognition principle (also called the matching principle) requires that costs incurred to generate revenues be recognized in the same period—a matching of costs with benefits. For example, when Chipotle’s restaurants provide food service to customers, revenue is earned. The costs of generating the revenue include expenses incurred such as these:  

•	 Salaries and wages to employees who worked during the period.   
•	 Utilities for the electricity used during the period.   
•	 Food, beverage, and packaging supplies used during the period.   
•	 Facilities rented during the period.   
•	 Grills and other equipment used during the period.  

As with revenues and cash receipts, expenses are recorded as incurred, regardless of when cash is paid. Cash may be paid (1) before, (2) during, or (3) after an expense is incurred (see Exhibit 3.3). An entry will be made on the date the expense is incurred and another on the date the cash is paid, if they occur at different times. Let’s see how to handle each of these cases related to the expense recognition principle.  

1	 Cash is paid before the expense is incurred to generate revenue. Companies purchase many assets that are used to generate revenues in future periods. Examples include buying insurance for future coverage, paying rent for future use of space, and acquiring supplies and equipment for future use. When revenues are generated in the future, the company records an expense for the portion of the cost of the assets used—costs are matched with the benefits. As an example, assume Chipotle signs a two-year ­contract with a repair company for service any time over the contracted years at no additional cost in exchange for a cash prepayment. When acquired, the service ­contract is recorded as an asset called Prepaid Expenses that will benefit future ­periods. When the service is used the following month, Repairs Expense is recorded for the month and the asset Prepaid Expenses is reduced to the balance yet to be used. ­Similarly, rent, insurance, and advertising that are prepaid are often recorded in an asset account called Prepaid Expenses and expensed when used.  

Cash is paid in the same period as the expense is incurred to generate revenue. Expenses are sometimes incurred and paid for in the period in which they arise. An example is paying for repairs on grills the day of the service. If Chipotle spends $\mathbb{S}275$ cash to repair grills so that food can be prepared to sell, an expense is incurred and recorded (Repairs Expense).

3	 Cash is paid after the cost is incurred to generate revenue. Although rent and supplies are typically purchased before they are used, many costs are paid after goods or services have been received and used, including using utilities in the current period that are not paid for until the following period, using borrowed funds and incurring Interest Expense to be paid in the future, and owing wages to employees who worked in the current period. When Chipotle restaurants receive repair service on the last day of the accounting period, and the bills are handed to the restaurant managers that day, the company records Repairs Expense and Accounts Payable in the period the service is used, not when cash is paid.

## P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K  

The expense recognition principle (or matching principle) requires that costs incurred to generate revenues be recognized in the same period—that costs are matched with the revenues they generate. Regardless of when cash is paid, expense is recorded when incurred.

## Management’s Incentives to Violate Accounting Rules  

Investors in the stock market base their decisions on their expectations of a company’s future earnings. When companies announce quarterly and annual earnings information, investors evaluate how well the companies have met expectations and adjust their investing decisions accordingly. Companies that fail to meet expectations often experience a decline in stock price. Thus, managers are motivated to produce earnings results that meet or exceed investors’ expectations to bolster stock prices. Greed may lead some managers to make unethical accounting and reporting decisions, often involving falsifying revenues and expenses. While this sometimes fools people for a short time, it rarely works in the long run and often leads to very bad consequences.  

Fraud is a criminal offense for which managers may be sentenced to jail. A couple of historic fraud cases involving faulty revenue and expense accounting are discussed briefly below:  

•	 In 2002, WorldCom, the second largest long-distance telephone company in the United States at the time (now merged into Verizon), violated the expense recognition principle by recording $\mathbb{S}11$ billion in expenses as assets, thus overstating assets and overstating net income. This act to inflate earnings was perpetrated to boost WorldCom’s sagging stock price. Bernie Ebbers, age 65 and former CEO of WorldCom, was convicted and found guilty in 2005 and subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison. At the time, this was the largest accounting fraud in U.S. history. [Post-script: Ebbers was released from prison in December 2019 due to declining health and died in February 2020.]  

ZZZZ Best was a carpet cleaning company started by teenager Barry Minkow who took the company public in 1986 when he was 20. However, the company was one of the largest accounting and investments frauds ever perpetrated by a single person. Among numerous criminal or questionable activities, Minkow violated the revenue recognition principle by creating fictitious sales to boost the company’s earnings and stock price and appear strong to attract large investment deals. But the company was a sham, one that its auditing firm failed to discover. At the age of 23, Minkow was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $\mathbb{S}26$ million in restitution. The audit firm paid $\mathbb{S}35$ million for failing to uncover the fraud. Investors and lenders reportedly lost $\mathbb{S}100$ million. [Post-script: After early release in 1995, Minkow pursued numerous fraudulent activities and was sentenced to federal prison two additional times before being released in 2019 and ordered to pay over $\mathbb{S}580$ million in restitution.]  

Many others are affected by accounting fraud. Shareholders lose stock value, employees may lose their jobs (and pension funds, as in the case of Enron), and customers and suppliers may become wary of dealing with a company operating under the cloud of fraud. As a manager, you may face an ethical dilemma in the workplace. The ethical decision to make is the one you will be proud of 20 years later.  

## THE EXPANDED TRANSACTION ANALYSIS MODEL  

We have discussed the variety of business activities affecting the income statement and how they are measured. Next, we need to determine how these business activities are recorded in the accounting system and reflected in the financial statements. Chapter 2 covered investing and financing activities that affect assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity. We now expand the transaction analysis model to include operating activities that also affect revenues and expenses.  

## Transaction Analysis Rules  

The complete transaction analysis model presented in Exhibit 3.4 includes all five elements: assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues, and expenses. Recall that the Retained Earnings account is the accumulation of all past revenues and expenses minus any income distributed to  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 3-4  

Apply transaction analysis to examine and record the effects of operating activities on the financial statements.  

![](images/2e161abe63e43bbf57cec7049e8cfe4f752c2e279af8196eba47c6041b241228.jpg)

DO memorize and use the transaction alysis model for all transactions. DON’T memorize journal entries—there are just too many throughout the text and they can be complex.  

stockholders as dividends (that is, earnings not retained in the business).5 When net income is positive, Retained Earnings increases; a net loss decreases Retained Earnings.  

To aid your learning, you should be able to construct the transaction analysis model in Exhibit 3.4 on your own without assistance and use it to analyze transactions. It will be very beneficial in future chapters when completing assignments and analyzing more complex transactions. Now let’s study Exhibit  3.4 carefully to remember how the model is constructed and to understand the impact of operating activities on both the balance sheet and income statement:  

•	 All accounts can increase or decrease, although revenues and expenses mostly tend to increase throughout a period. For accounts on the left side of the accounting equation, the increase symbol $+$ is written on the left side of the T-account. For accounts on the right side of the accounting equation, the increase symbol $+$ is written on the right side of the T-account, except for expenses, which increase on the left side of the T-account. That is because, as expenses increase, they have an opposite effect on net income, the Retained Earnings account (which increases on the credit side), and thus Stockholders’ Equity.  

•	 Debits (dr) are written on the left of each T-account and credits (cr) are written on the right.  

•	 Every transaction affects at least two accounts.  

When a revenue or expense is recorded, either an asset or a liability will be affected as well:  

•	 Revenues increase stockholders’ equity through the account Retained Earnings and therefore have credit balances (the positive side of Retained Earnings). Recording revenue requires either increasing an asset (such as Accounts Receivable when selling goods on account to customers) or decreasing a liability (such as Unearned Revenue that was recorded in the past when cash was received from customers before being earned).  

•	 Expenses decrease stockholders’ equity through Retained Earnings. As expenses increase, they have the opposite effect on net income, which affects Retained Earnings. Therefore, they have debit balances (opposite of the positive credit side in Retained Earnings). That is, to increase an expense, you debit it, thereby decreasing net income and Retained Earnings. Recording an expense requires either decreasing an asset (such as Supplies when used) or increasing a liability (such as Wages Payable when money is owed to employees).  

When revenues exceed expenses, the company reports net income, increasing Retained Earnings and stockholders’ equity. However, when expenses exceed revenues, a net loss results that decreases Retained Earnings and thus stockholders’ equity.  

## EXHIBIT 3.5  

Steps for Analyzing Any Transaction  

Step 1: Was a revenue earned by delivering goods or services? • If so, debit the account for what was received $(+\mathbf{A},-\mathbf{L})$ and credit the revenue account $(+\mathbf{R},+\mathbf{S}\mathbf{E})$  

OR	 Was an expense incurred to generate revenue in the current period?  

• If so, debit the expense account $(+\mathbf{E},-\mathbf{S}\mathbf{E})$ and credit the account for what was given $(-\mathbf{A},+\mathbf{L})$  

OR,	 if neither a revenue was earned or an expense was incurred, what was received and given? debit the account for what was received $(+\mathbf{A},-\mathbf{L})$ credit the account for what was given $(-\mathbf{A},+\mathbf{L})$  

Step 2:	 Verify $\rightarrow$ Is the accounting equation in balance? (Does $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{S}\mathbf{E}?$ ) Do debits $=$ credits?  

Example: Chipotle delivers a food order for $\pm25$ and receives cash from the customer.  

SStteepp  11::      YYeess Cash (received) $(+\mathbf{A})$ 25 Restaurant sales revenue $(+\mathbf{R},+\mathbf{S}\mathbf{E})$  

SStteepp  22::      YYeess  

$$
\textrm{A}25=\textrm{L}0+\textrm{S E}25\frac{\textrm{A}}{+25}=\frac{\textrm{L}}{+25}+\frac{5\mathsf{E}}{+25}
$$  

ddeebbiittss $=$ credits? Yes Debits 25; Credits 25  

In summary:

## Expenses increase on  

the left side (the debit side) of the T-account to reduce net income, retained earnings, and stockholders’ equity.  

The steps to follow in analyzing transactions presented in Chapter 2 are now modified to determine the effects of earning revenues and incurring expenses as well. Now, as shown in Exhibit 3.5, when a transaction occurs, the questions to ask are (1) was a revenue earned or expense incurred and (2) is the accounting equation in balance based on the analysis.  

## Analyzing Common Transactions  

Next, we continue our discussion with hypothetical operating activities for Chipotle Mexican Grill, building on the company’s trial balance presented in Exhibit 2.8 (in Chapter 2) that included only investing and financing transactions assumed to have occurred during the first quarter of 2020.  

Using the transaction analysis steps in Exhibit  3.5, we now analyze, record, and post to the T-accounts the effects of this chapter’s operating activities that we assume occurred ­during the first quarter. The T-accounts begin with the trial balance amounts in Exhibit 2.8. All amounts are in millions of dollars, except per share information. You should notice, in each journal entry, that:  

•	 When a revenue or expense is recorded, we insert $(+\boldsymbol{\mathrm{R}},+\boldsymbol{\mathrm{SE}})$ for revenues and $(+\mathrm{E},-\mathrm{SE})$ for expenses to emphasize the effect of the transaction on the accounting equation and to help you see that the equation remains in balance.  

•	 Debits equal credits—another check you should make when preparing journal entries.  

(1)	 During the first quarter, assume Chipotle sold food and beverages to customers for $^{\S1,359}$ ; $\pmb{\mathbb{S44}}$ was sold to universities on account (to be paid by the universities next quarter) and the rest was received in cash from customers. NOTE: To measure revenues and expenses in a new period, these accounts begin with $\mathbb{S}0$ balances.

We just illustrated the steps in analyzing and recording transactions, including those involving earning revenue and incurring expenses.  

Transaction Analysis Steps:  

Step 1: Ask $\rightarrow$ Was a revenue earned by delivering goods or services? · If so, debit the account for what was received $(+\mathbf{A},-\mathbf{L})$ and credit the revenue account $(+\mathbf{R},+\mathbf{S}\mathbf{E})$ OR Was an expense incurred to generate revenue in the current period? · If so, debit the expense account $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{+E},$ ,-SE) and credit the account for what was given $(-\mathbf{A},+\mathbf{L})$ OR, if neither a revenue was earned or an expense was incurred, what was received and given? debit the account for what was received $(+\mathbf{A},-\mathbf{L})$ credit the account for what was given $(-\mathbf{A},+\mathbf{L})$  

Step 2: Verify $\rightarrow$ Is the accounting equation in balance? (Does $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{S}\mathbf{E}?$ ddeebbiittss $=$ credits?

## HOW IS THE INCOME STATEMENT PREPARED AND ANALYZED?  

As we discussed in Chapter 2, companies can prepare financial statements at any point in time. Before we consider creating any statements for Chipotle, however, we must first determine that the debits equal credits by generating a trial balance. Accounts are listed in financial statement order: assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues/gains, and expenses/losses. The balances are taken from the T-accounts in Exhibit 3.6.

Microsoft Corporation  

Although debits do equal credits, why is the trial balance labeled “unadjusted”? Does it make sense that supplies were purchased during the quarter, but no Supplies Expense was recorded to show the amount of supplies used? How likely is it that gift cards were sold, but none were redeemed by customers during the quarter? And didn’t Chipotle use property and equipment during the quarter to generate revenues? The answer to all of these questions is that no end-of-period adjustments have been made yet to reflect all revenues earned and expenses incurred during the quarter. Therefore, the trial balance is unadjusted until all adjustments are made, as we illustrate in Chapter 4.  

## Classified Income Statement  

Exhibit 3.7 presents the classified income statement. Classified means it is categorized into Operating activities and Other items, but note that, because it is based on unadjusted balances, it would not be presented to external users.  

When comparing this statement with Chipotle’s 2019 income statement in Exhibit 3.1, we notice that the income from operations for the first quarter $(\Phi794)$ exceeds income from operations for all of 2019 $(\Phi444)$ . Because a more representative amount for one quarter would be about 25 percent, obviously, numerous adjustments are necessary to revenues and expenses, such as providing food service to customers with gift cards (earning a revenue) and using food, packaging, and beverage supplies, renting facilities, and using buildings and equipment during the quarter to generate revenue (incurring expenses). We would not want to use the information for analysis until it has been adjusted. Instead, we use the 2019 income statement in Exhibit 3.1 to determine how effective Chipotle’s management is at generating profit.

## INTERPRETATIONS  

In General Net profit margin measures how much of every sales dollar generated during the period is profit. Over time, a rising net profit margin signals more efficient management of sales and expenses. Differences among industries result from the nature of the products or services provided and the intensity of competition. Differences among competitors in the same industry reflect how each company responds to changes in competition (and demand for the product or service) and changes in managing sales volume, sales price, and costs. Financial analysts expect well-run businesses to maintain or improve their net profit margin over time.  

Focus Company Analysis Chipotle’s net profit margin varied over the three-year period. The 2017 and 2018 ratios were below $\mathbb{S}0.04$ in net income for every dollar of sales revenue. Management reported that, although sales revenue increased both of those years, costs increased as well. In March 2018, Chipotle hired Brian Niccol as Chief Executive Officer, with great hopes of re-energizing the company after a string of food safety issues in prior years. Under his leadership, in 2018, the company undertook a corporate restructuring, including a move of its headquarters to Newport Beach, CA, consolidation or closure of other corporate offices, and incurred additional costs as a result (such as, employee severance and transition costs, relocation costs, and lease termination costs among others). The company also started equipping restaurants with second food “make lines” to address the growing delivery and pick-up orders. In 2019, the net profit margin jumped to 6.27 percent, as sales revenue continued to increase (much of that due to a 7.1 percent increase in digital sales) and operating costs as a percentage of revenues decreased, despite its continuing investment in improved digital platforms and expanded delivery capabilities. This suggests that, from 2018 to 2019, Chipotle’s management was more effective at generating revenues and controlling costs.  

El Pollo Loco and Shake Shack each had a lower net profit margin than Chipotle, suggesting that Chipotle was more effective at generating revenue while controlling costs than those competitors in 2019. El Pollo Loco had a 2 percent increase in restaurant sales, opened only two company-operated and two franchised restaurants, and had an increase in labor, delivery, utility, and repair costs. Shake Shack also expanded its number of restaurant openings and partnered with Grubhub to expand delivery service. Revenue increased over 29 percent, but operating costs grew faster which included one-time costs for upgrading financial and operational systems to support growth initiatives. Differences in business strategies, size, and locations explain some of the variation in ratio analysis across competitors.  

A Few Cautions The decisions that management makes to maintain the company’s net profit margin in the current period may have negative long-run implications. Analysts should perform additional analysis of the ratio to identify trends in each component of revenues and expenses. This involves dividing each line on the income statement by net sales. Statements presented with these percentages are called commonsized income statements. Changes in the percentages of the individual components of net income provide information on shifts in management’s strategies.  

## Operating Activities  

In this chapter, we focus on cash flows from operating activities: cash from operating sources, primarily customers, and cash to suppliers and others involved in operations. The accounts most often associated with operating activities are current assets, such as Accounts Receivable, Inventories, and Prepaid Expenses, and current liabilities, such as Accounts Payable, Wages Payable, and Unearned Revenue.  

As discussed in Chapter 2, companies report cash inflows and outflows over a period of time in their statement of cash flows. This statement is divided into three categories:  

•	 	O — Operating activities include those primarily with customers and suppliers, and interest payments on debt and earnings on investments.   
I — Investing activities include buying and selling noncurrent assets and investments.   
•	  F — Financing activities include borrowing and repaying debt, including short-term bank loans; issuing and repurchasing stock; and paying dividends.  

Only transactions affecting cash are reported on the statement. An important step in constructing and analyzing the statement of cash flows (discussed in Chapter 12) is identifying the various transactions as operating, investing, or financing. Let’s analyze the Cash T-account for Chipotle’s assumed transactions in this chapter, adding to transactions (a)—(g) from Chapter 2. Refer to transactions $(I){-}(I I)$ illustrated earlier in the chapter and remember, if you see Cash in a transaction, it will be reflected on the statement of cash flows.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 3-7  

Identify operating transactions and demonstrate how they affect cash flows.

As we discussed, every transaction affecting cash can be classified either as an operating, investing, or financing effect.  

Operating effects relate to receipts of cash from customers, payments to suppliers (employees, utilities, and other suppliers of goods and services for operating the business), and any interest paid or investment income received.  

Investing effects relate to purchasing/selling investments or property and equipment or lending funds to/receiving repayment from others.  

Financing effects relate to borrowing or repaying banks, issuing stock to investors, repurchasing stock from investors, or paying dividends to investors.

## C H A P T E R  T A K E - A W A Y S  

3-1.	 Describe a typical business operating cycle and explain the necessity for the time period assumption. p. 110  

The operating cycle, or cash-to-cash cycle, is the time needed to purchase goods or services from suppliers, sell the goods or services to customers, and collect cash from customers. Time period assumption—to measure and report financial information periodically, we assume the long life of a company can be cut into shorter periods.  

3-2.	 Explain how business activities affect the elements of the income statement. p. 112 •	 Elements of the income statement: a.	Revenues—the amounts earned and recorded from a company’s day-to-day business activities, mostly when a company sells products or provides services to customers or clients (the central focus of the business). b.	Expenses—the costs of operating the business that are incurred to generate revenues during the period. c.	Gains—result primarily from the disposal of assets for more than their cost minus the amount of cost depreciated in the past. d.	Losses—result primarily from the disposal of assets for less than their cost minus the amount of cost depreciated in the past.  

3-3.	 Explain the accrual basis of accounting and apply the revenue and expense recognition principles to measure income. p. 116  

In accrual basis accounting, revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred.  

•	 Revenue recognition principle—recognize revenues (1) when the company transfers promised goods or services to customers (2) in the amount it expects to be entitled to receive. The five-step model for determining when and the amount to recognize revenue is:  

(1)	 identify the contract,   
(2)	 identify the seller’s performance obligations (promised goods and services), (3)	 determine the transaction price,   
(4)	 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and   
(5)	 recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.  

Expense recognition principle (matching)—recognize expenses when they are incurred in generating revenue (a matching of costs with benefits).  

3-4.	 Apply transaction analysis to examine and record the effects of operating activities on the financial statements. p. 121  

The expanded transaction analysis model includes revenues and expenses:  

![](images/d639d8bb328d2a59b0bf609ad47ba7aa534b4e29fde64730e20b8f886fc96cab.jpg)  

3-5.	 Prepare a classified income statement. p. 129  

Until the accounts have been updated to include all revenues earned and expenses incurred in the period (due to a difference in the timing of when cash is received or paid), the financial statements are unadjusted:  

•	 Income Statement—net income is needed to determine ending Retained Earnings; classifications include Operating Revenues, Operating Expenses (to determine Income from Operations), Other Items (to determine Pretax Income), Income Tax Expense, Net Income (or Net Loss), and Earnings per Share [Net income (or loss) $\div$ Weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding].  

3-6.	 Compute and interpret the net profit margin ratio. p. 131  

The net profit margin ratio (Net Income [or Net Loss] $\div$ Net Sales [or Operating Revenues]) measures the profit generated per dollar of sales (operating revenues). The higher the ratio when compared to competitors or over time, the more effective the company is at generating revenues and/or controlling costs.  

3-7.	 Identify operating activities and demonstrate how they affect cash flows. p. 133  

On the Statement of Cash Flows, operating activities include those primarily with customers and suppliers, but interest payments and earnings on investments are also included, unlike how these are reported on the income statement (under Other Items). Only when cash is received or paid in an operating activity is the statement of cash flows affected.  

In this chapter, we discussed the operating cycle and accounting concepts relevant to income determination: the time period assumption, definitions of the income statement elements (revenues, expenses, gains, and losses), the revenue recognition principle, and the expense recognition principle. The accounting principles are defined in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting, which requires revenues to be recorded when earned and expenses to be recorded when incurred in the process of generating revenues. We expanded the transaction analysis model introduced in Chapter 2 by adding revenues and expenses and prepared an unadjusted classified income statement. In Chapter 4, we discuss the activities that occur at the end of the accounting period: the adjustment process, the preparation of adjusted financial statements, and the closing process.  

Net profit margin ratio measures the profit generated per dollar of sales (operating revenues). A high ratio as compared to competitors or over time suggests that a company is generating revenues and/or controlling expenses more effectively. The ratio is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box on pages 131–132):

4.	 A Target shareholder has complained that “more dividends should be paid because the company had net earnings of $\mathbb{S4},368$ million. Since this amount is all cash, more of it should go to the owners.” Is this a valid assumption and why?  

a.	 The assumption is not valid, because the reported amount of net earnings is based on applying accrual accounting principles in which revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred, regardless of when cash is received or paid. $b$ .	 The assumption is valid, because the income statement is based on applying the cash accounting principles in which cash received is revenue and cash paid is an expense. c.	 The assumption is valid because Target has $^{\mathbb{S}8,511}$ in cash to distribute. d.	 The assumption is not valid, because, over the life of the business, total earnings will not equal total net cash flow. 5.	 What is Target’s net profit margin ratio for the most recent year based on total revenue and what does is suggest about Target? a.	 0.0390, suggesting that Target earned $\mathbb{S}3.90\$ for every dollar of total revenue. b.	 0.0699, suggesting that Target is doing very well. c.	 0.0467, suggesting that Target earned $\mathbb{S}4.67$ for every dollar of total revenue. d.	 0.0473, suggesting that Target earned $\mathbb{S}4.73$ for every dollar of sales.

## Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma  

Mike Lynch is the manager of an upstate New York regional office for an insurance company. As the regional manager, his compensation package comprises a base salary, commissions, and a bonus when the region sells new policies in excess of its quota. Mike has been under enormous pressure lately, stemming largely from two factors. First, he is experiencing a mounting personal debt due to a family member’s illness. Second, compounding his worries, the region’s sales of new policies have dipped below the normal quota for the first time in years.  

You have been working for Mike for two years, and like everyone else in the office, you consider yourself lucky to work for such a supportive boss. You also feel great sympathy for his personal problems over the last few months. In your position as accountant for the regional office, you are only too aware of the drop in new policy sales and the impact this will have on the manager’s bonus. While you are working late at year-end, Mike stops by your office.  

Mike asks you to change the manner in which you have accounted for a new property insurance policy for a large local business. A substantial check for the premium came in the mail on December 31, the last day of the reporting year. The premium covers a period beginning on January 5. You deposited the check and correctly debited Cash and credited an unearned revenue account. Mike says, “Hey, we have the money this year, so why not count the revenue this year? I never did understand why you accountants are so picky about these things anyway. I’d like you to change the way you have recorded the transaction. I want you to credit a revenue account. And anyway, I’ve done favors for you in the past, and I am asking for such a small thing in return.” With that, he leaves for the day.  

Required:  

1.	 How should you handle this situation?   
2.	 What are the ethical implications of Mike’s request?   
3.	 Who are the parties who would be helped or harmed if you complied with the request?   
4.	 If you fail to comply with his request, how will you explain your position to him in the morning?
