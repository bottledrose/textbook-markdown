# Ch12 Statement of Cash Flows  

While once best known for its Shasta and Faygo carbonated soft drinks, National Beverage now focuses on its innovative LaCroix sparkling waters, Rip It energy products, and Everfresh juices. These products bring its well-known reputation for flavor variety to the growing number of health-conscious consumers. “Healthy Transformation” and “Flavor Innovation” combined with attractive packaging are its key points of differentiation from its much larger competitors. And its diverse product lines can meet all of the beverage needs of a wide variety of consumers and retailers. However, for its strategy to earn profits for shareholders, National Beverage also must be a cost-effective producer and distributor. It maintains product quality and cost discipline through centralized purchasing and by owning and operating all of its production and bottling facilities. Its 12 plants, strategically located near customer distribution centers in different markets, reduce distribution costs and allow National Beverage to tailor its products and media promotions to regional tastes.  

Although it may seem puzzling, growing profitable operations do not always ensure positive cash flow. As we have seen in earlier chapters, this occurs because the timing of revenues and expenses does not always match cash inflows and outflows. As a consequence, National Beverage must carefully manage cash flows as well as profits. For the same reasons, financial analysts must consider the information provided in National Beverage’s cash flow statement in addition to its income statement and balance sheet.

## UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS  

Clearly, net income is important, but cash flow is also critical to a company’s success. Cash flow permits a company to expand operations, replace worn assets, take advantage of new investment opportunities, and pay dividends to its owners. Some Wall Street analysts go so far as to say “Cash flow is king.” Both managers and analysts need to understand the various sources and uses of cash that are associated with business activity.  

The cash flow statement focuses attention on a firm’s ability to generate cash internally, its management of operating assets and liabilities, and the details of its investments and its external financing. It is designed to help both managers and analysts answer important cash-related questions such as these:  

Will the company have enough cash to pay its short-term debts to suppliers and other creditors without additional borrowing?   
Is the company adequately managing its accounts receivable and inventory?   
Has the company made necessary investments in new productive capacity?   
•  Did the company generate enough cash flow internally to finance necessary investments, or did it rely on external financing?   
•  Is the company changing the makeup of its external financing?  

We begin our discussion with an overview of the statement of cash flows. Then we examine the information reported in each section of the statement in depth. The chapter ends with a discussion of additional cash flow disclosures.

• Preliminary Steps in Preparing the Cash Flow Statement  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 12-1  

Classify cash flow statement items as part of net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.  

## CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS  

Basically, the statement of cash flows explains how the amount of cash on the balance sheet at the beginning of the period has become the amount of cash reported at the end of the period. For purposes of this statement, the definition of cash includes cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are both  

1.	Readily convertible to known amounts of cash and  

2.	So near to maturity there is little risk that their value will change if interest rates change.  

Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify as a cash equivalent under this definition.1 Examples of cash equivalents are Treasury bills (a form of short-term U.S. government debt), money market funds, and commercial paper (short-term notes payable issued by large corporations).  

As you can see in Exhibit 12.1, the statement of cash flows reports cash inflows and outflows in three broad categories: (1) operating activities, (2) investing activities, and (3) financing activities. Together, these three cash flow categories explain the change in cash from the beginning balance to the ending balance on the balance sheet.

## Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

Cash flows from operating activities (cash flows from operations) are the cash inflows and outflows that relate directly to revenues and expenses reported on the income statement. There are two alternative approaches for presenting the operating activities section of the statement:  

1.	The direct method reports the components of cash flows from operating activities as gross receipts and gross payments.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Inflows</td><td>Outflows</td></tr><tr><td>Cashreceivedfrom: Customers Dividendsandinterestoninvestments</td><td>Cash paid for: Purchaseofservices(electricity,etc.) andgoodsforresale Salariesandwages Incometaxes Interestonliabilities</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The difference between the inflows and outflows is called net cash provided by (used by) operating activities. National Beverage experienced a net cash inflow of $\mathbb{S}142{,}077$ (all amounts in thousands) from its operations for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019 (hereafter 2019). Though the FASB recommends the direct method, it is rarely used in the United States. Many financial executives have reported that they do not use it because it is more expensive to implement than the indirect method. Both the FASB and the IASB are considering a proposal to require this method, but intense opposition from the preparer community continues.  

2.	The indirect method starts with net income from the income statement and then eliminates noncash items to arrive at net cash inflow (outflow) from operating activities.  

![](images/fea5027e59ec0f762df322b169ff5cccd1afa71f38282c1b97a795fe7bdc157c.jpg)  
Use of Direct and Indirect Method by U.S. Companies  

Net income +/− Adjustments for noncash items Net cash inflow (outflow) from operating activities  

Ninety-nine percent of large U.S. companies, including National Beverage, use the indirect method.2 Notice in Exhibit 12.1 that in 2019 National Beverage reported positive net income of $\mathbb{S}140{,}853$ but generated positive cash flows from operating activities of $\mathbb{S}142{,}077$ . Why would income and cash flows from operating activities differ? Remember that on the income statement, revenues are recorded when they are earned, withou regard to when the related cash inflows occur. Similarly, expenses are matched with revenues and recorded without regard to when the related cash outflows occur.  

For now, the most important thing to remember about the two methods is that they are simply alternative ways to arrive at the same number. The total amount of cash flows from operating activities is always the same (an inflow of $^{\S142,077}$ in National Beverage’s case), regardless of whether it is computed using the direct or indirect method, as illustrated below.  

![](images/a0f906781a2d365eca278c73b01140b847843bd944e78af2ee9ab88756b28268.jpg)  

Cash flow from operating activities is the same regardless of   
whether it is computed using

\*The direct amounts are estimated from National Beverage’s disclosures.  

## Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

Cash flows from investing activities are cash inflows and outflows related to the purchase and disposal of long-lived productive assets and investments in the securities of other companies. Typical cash flows from investing activities include  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Inflows</td><td>Outflows</td></tr><tr><td>Cashreceivedfrom: Sale or disposal of property,plant,</td><td>Cash paid for: Purchaseofproperty,plant,</td></tr><tr><td>and equipment Saleormaturityofinvestmentsin securities</td><td>andequipment Purchaseofinvestmentsin securities</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The difference between these cash inflows and outflows is called net cash provided by (used by) investing activities.  

For National Beverage, this amount was an outflow of $\mathbb{S}35{,}882$ for 2019. All of the activity was related to purchases and sales of short-term investments and the purchase and sale of property, plant, and equipment. Because total purchases exceeded cash collected from sales, there was a net cash outflow.  

## Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

Cash flows from financing activities include exchanges of cash with creditors (debtholders) and owners (stockholders). Usual cash flows from financing activities include the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Inflows</td><td>Outflows</td></tr><tr><td>Cashreceivedfrom: Borrowing on notes,mortgages,bonds,etc., fromcreditors Issuingstocktoowners</td><td>Cash paid for: Repayment of principal to creditors (excluding interest, which is an operating activity) Repurchasingstockfromowners Dividendstoowners</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The difference between these cash inflows and outflows is called net cash provided by (used by) financing activities.  

National Beverage experienced a net cash outflow from financing activities of $\mathbb{S}138{,}990$ for 2019. The Financing Activities section of its statement shows that National Beverage received proceeds in the amount of $\mathbb{S}825$ from issuing long-term debt and $\mathbb{S}1{,}576$ from issuing stock and paid $^{\Phi141,391}$ in dividends.3  

## Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash  

The combination of the net cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities must equal the net increase (decrease) in cash for the reporting period. For the year 2019, National Beverage reported a net decrease in cash of $\mathbb{5}32,795$ , which explains the change in cash on the balance sheet from the beginning balance of $\mathbb{S}189{,}864$ to the ending balance of $^{\mathbb{S}157,069}$ .  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Netcashprovidedbyoperating activities</td><td>$142,077</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities</td><td>(35,882) (138,990)</td></tr><tr><td>Netcashusedinfinancingactivities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Netdecreaseincashandequivalents</td><td>(32,795) 189,864</td></tr><tr><td>Cash-Beginningofyear Cash-Endofyear</td><td>Beginningandendingba $157,069 fromthebalancesheet</td></tr></table></body></html>  

We just discussed the three main sections of the cash flow statement: Cash Flows from Operating Activities, which are related to earning income from normal operations; Cash Flows from Investing Activities, which are related to the acquisition and sale of productive assets; and Cash Flows from Financing Activities, which are related to external financing of the enterprise. The net cash inflow or outflow for the year is the same amount as the increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year on the balance sheet. To make sure you understand the appropriate classifications of the different cash flows, answer the following questions before you move on.

Related Homework: M12-3, E12-3  

To give you a better understanding of the statement of cash flows, we now discuss National Beverage’s statement in more detail, including the way in which it relates to the balance sheet and income statement. Then we examine how each section of the statement describes a set of important decisions made by National Beverage’s management. Last, we examine how financial analysts use each section to evaluate the company’s performance.  

## Relationships to the Balance Sheet and Income Statement  

Preparing and interpreting the cash flow statement requires an analysis of the balance sheet and income statement accounts that relate to the three sections of the cash flow statement. In previous chapters, we emphasized that companies record transactions as journal entries that are posted to T-accounts, which are used to prepare the income statement and the balance sheet. But companies cannot prepare the statement of cash flows using the amounts recorded in the T-accounts because those amounts are based on accrual accounting. Instead, they must analyze the numbers recorded under the accrual method and adjust them to a cash basis. To prepare the statement of cash flows, they need the following data:  

1.	Comparative balance sheets used in calculating the cash flows from all activities (operating, investing, and financing).   
2.	A complete income statement used primarily in calculating cash flows from operating activities.   
3.	Additional details concerning selected accounts where the total change in an account balance during the year does not reveal the underlying nature of the cash flows.  

Our approach to preparing and understanding the cash flow statement focuses on the changes in the balance sheet accounts. It relies on a simple manipulation of the balance sheet equation:  

​Assets $=$ Liabilities $^+$ Stockholders’ Equity  

First, assets can be split into cash and noncash assets:  

​Cash + Noncash Assets $=$ Liabilities $^+$ Stockholders’ Equity  

If we move the noncash assets to the right side of the equation, then ​Cash $=$ Liabilities $^+$ Stockholders’ Equity − Noncash Assets  

1. F 2. O 3. O 4. I 5. I  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Transaction</td><td>Cash Effect</td><td>OtherAccountAffected</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">Operating</td><td>Collectaccountsreceivable</td><td>+Cash</td><td>-Accounts Receivable (A)</td></tr><tr><td>Pay accounts payable</td><td>-Cash</td><td>-Accounts Payable (L)</td></tr><tr><td>Prepay rent</td><td>-Cash</td><td>+Prepaid Rent (A)</td></tr><tr><td>Pay interest</td><td>-Cash</td><td>-Retained Earnings (SE)</td></tr><tr><td>Sale for cash</td><td>+Cash</td><td>+Retained Earnings (SE)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Investing</td><td>Purchase equipmentfor cash</td><td>-Cash</td><td>+Equipment (A)</td></tr><tr><td>Sell investment securities for cash</td><td>+Cash</td><td>-Investments (A)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Financing</td><td>Pay back debt to bank</td><td>-Cash</td><td>-Notes Payable-Bank (L)</td></tr><tr><td>Issue stockfor cash</td><td>+Cash</td><td>+CommonStockandAdditional</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Paid-in Capital (SE)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Given this relationship, the changes $(\Delta)$ in cash between the beginning and the end of the period must equal the changes $(\Delta)$ in the amounts on the right side of the equation between the beginning and the end of the period:  

$$
\triangle\mathsf{C a s h}=\triangle\mathsf{L i a b i l i t i e s}+\triangle\mathsf{S t o c k h o l d e r s}^{\prime}\mathsf{E q u i t y}-\triangle\mathsf{N o n c a s h}\mathsf{A s s e t s}
$$  

Thus, any transaction that changes cash must be accompanied by a change in liabilities, stockholders’ equity, or noncash assets. Exhibit 12.2 illustrates this concept for selected cash transactions.  

## Preliminary Steps in Preparing the Cash Flow Statement  

Based on this logic, we use the following preliminary steps to prepare the cash flow statement:  

1.	Determine the change in each balance sheet account. From this year’s ending balance, subtract this year’s beginning balance (i.e., last year’s ending balance).   
2.	Classify each change as relating to operating (O), investing (I), or financing (F) activities by marking them with the corresponding letter. Use Exhibit 12.3 as a guide.  

The balance sheet accounts related to earning income (operating items) should be marked with an O. These accounts are often called operating assets and liabilities. The accounts that should be marked with an O include the following:  

Selected Cash Transactions and Their Effects on Other Balance Sheet Accounts  

## EXHIBIT 12.2  

•	 Most current assets (other than short-term investments, which relate to investing activities, and cash).   
•	 Most current liabilities (other than amounts owed to investors and financial institutions,5 all of which relate to financing activities).   
•	 Retained Earnings, because it increases by the amount of net income, which is the starting point for the operating section. (Retained Earnings also decreases by dividends declared and paid, which is a financing outflow noted by an F.)

In Exhibit 12.3, all of the operating assets and liabilities have been marked with an O. These items include  

•	 Accounts Receivable •	 Inventories •	 Prepaid Expenses •	 Accounts Payable •	 Accrued Expenses  

As we have noted, retained earnings are also relevant to operations.  

The balance sheet accounts related to investing activities should be marked with an I. These include all of the remaining assets on the balance sheet. In Exhibit 12.3 these items include  

•	 Short-Term Investments •	 Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net  

The balance sheet accounts related to financing activities should be marked with an F. These include all of the remaining liability and stockholders’ equity accounts on the balance sheet. In Exhibit 12.3 these items include  

•	 Long-Term Debt   
•	 Common Stock   
•	 Additional Paid-in Capital   
•	 Retained Earnings (for decreases resulting from dividends declared and paid)  

Next, we use this information to prepare each section of the statement of cash flows.  

## REPORTING AND INTERPRETING CASH FLOWSFROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  

As noted earlier, the operating section can be prepared in two formats, and nearly all U.S. companies choose the indirect method. As a result, we discuss the indirect method here and the direct method in Supplement A at the end of the chapter.  

Recall that  

1.	Cash flow from operating activities is always the same regardless of whether it is computed using the direct or indirect method.   
2.	The investing and financing sections are always presented in the same manner regardless of the format of the operating section.  

## Reporting Cash Flows from Operating Activities—Indirect Method  

Exhibit 12.3 shows National Beverage’s comparative balance sheets and income statement. Remember that the indirect method starts with net income and converts it to cash flows from operating activities. This involves adjusting net income for the differences in the timing of accrual basis net income and cash flows. The general structure of the operating activities section is  

## Operating Activities  

Net income   
Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flow from operating activities: $^+$ Depreciation and amortization expense − Gain on sale of investing assets $^+$ Loss on sale of investing assets $^+$ Decreases in operating assets $^+$ Increases in operating liabilities − Increases in operating assets − Decreases in operating liabilities   
Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 12-2  

Report and interpret cash flows from operating activities using the indirect method.  

The indirect method operating activities section starts with net income and removes revenues and expenses that do not affect cash.

Subtotal on the statement of cash flows.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

To keep track of all the additions and subtractions made to convert net income to cash flows from operating activities, it is helpful to set up a schedule to record the computations. We will construct a schedule for National Beverage in Exhibit 12.4.  

We begin our schedule presented in Exhibit 12.4 with net income of $\mathbb{S}140{,}853$ taken from National Beverage’s income statement (Exhibit 12.3). Completing the operating section using the indirect method involves two steps:  

Step 1:	 Adjust net income for depreciation and amortization expense and gains and losses on sale of investing assets such as property, plant, and equipment and investments. Recording depreciation and amortization expense does not affect the cash account (or any other operating asset or liability). It affects a noncurrent investing asset (Property, plant, and equipment, net). Because depreciation and amortization expense is subtracted in computing net income but does not affect cash, we always add it back to convert net income to cash flow from operating activities. In the case of National Beverage, we need to remove the effect of depreciation and amortization expense by adding back $^{\S13,444}$ to net income (see Exhibit 12.4).  

If National Beverage had sold property, plant, and equipment at a gain or loss, the amount of cash received would be classified as an investing cash inflow. Because all of the cash received is an investing cash flow, an adjustment also must be made in the operating activities section to avoid double counting the gain or loss. Gains on sales of property, plant, and equipment are subtracted and losses on such sales are added to convert net income to cash flow from operating activities. We illustrate the relevant computations and adjustments for gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets in Supplement B at the end of the chapter.  

Step 2:	 Adjust net income for changes in assets and liabilities marked as operating (O). Each change in operating assets (other than cash and short-term investments) and liabilities (other than amounts owed to owners and financial institutions) causes a difference between net income and cash flow from operating activities. When converting net income to cash flow from operating activities, apply the following general rules:  

Add the change when an operating asset decreases or an operating liability increases.   
Subtract the change when an operating asset increases or an operating liability decreases.  

Understanding what makes these assets and liabilities increase and decrease is the key to understanding the logic of these additions and subtractions.  

## Change in Accounts Receivable  

We illustrate this logic with the first operating item (O) listed on National Beverage’s balance sheet (Exhibit 12.3), accounts receivable. Remember that the income statement reflects sales revenue, but the cash flow statement must reflect cash collections from customers. As the following accounts receivable T-account illustrates, when sales revenues are recorded, accounts receivable increases, and when cash is collected from customers, accounts receivable decreases.  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan="3">Accounts Receivable (A)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Change $481</td><td>Beginning balance</td><td>84,360</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Salesrevenue (on account)</td><td>1,014,105</td><td>Collectionsfromcustomers 1,013,624</td></tr><tr><td>Ending gbalance</td><td>84,841</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

In the National Beverage example, cash collections from customers are less than sales revenue reported on the income statement by $\S1,\!014,\!105-\S1,\!013,\!624=\S481.$ Because less money was collected from customers, this amount must be subtracted from net income to convert to cash flows from operating activities. Note that this amount is also the same as the change in the accounts receivable account:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Ending balance 一 Beginning balance</td><td>$84,841</td></tr><tr><td>Change</td><td>84,360 481</td></tr></table></body></html>  

This same underlying logic is used to determine adjustments for the other operating assets and liabilities.  

To summarize, the income statement reflects revenues of the period, but cash flow from operating activities must reflect cash collections from customers. Sales on account increase the balance in accounts receivable, and collections from customers decrease the balance.

(Exhibit 12.3) indicates an increase in accounts receivable of $\mathbb{S}481$ for the period, which means that cash collected from customers is lower than revenue. To convert to cash flows from operating activities, the amount of the increase (the amount of sales over and above collections) must be subtracted in Exhibit 12.4. (A decrease is added.)

## Change in Inventory  

The income statement reflects merchandise sold for the period, whereas cash flow from operating activities must reflect cash purchases. As shown in the Inventories T-account, purchases of goods increase the balance in inventory, and recording merchandise sold decreases the balance in inventory.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Inventories (A)</td><td colspan="3">Inventories (A)</td></tr><tr><td>Beg. balance</td><td></td><td>Beg.</td><td>60,920</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Purchases</td><td>Costs of goods sold</td><td>Increase</td><td>9,782</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>End.bal.</td><td></td><td>End.</td><td>70,702</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

National Beverage’s balance sheet (Exhibit 12.3) indicates that inventory increased by $\mathbb{S}9\mathrm{,}782$ , which means that the amount of purchases is more than the amount of merchandise sold. The increase (the extra goods purchased) must be subtracted from net income to convert to cash flow from operating activities in Exhibit 12.4. (A decrease is added.)  

## Change in Prepaid Expenses  

The income statement reflects expenses of the period, but cash flow from operating activities must reflect the cash payments. Cash prepayments increase the balance in prepaid expenses, and recording of expenses decreases the balance in prepaid expenses.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Prepaid Expenses (A)</td><td colspan="3">Prepaid Expenses (A)</td></tr><tr><td>Beg. bal.</td><td></td><td>Beg.</td><td>12,476</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cashp prepayments</td><td>Servicesused (expense)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Decrease 5,676</td></tr><tr><td>End.bal.</td><td></td><td>End.</td><td>6,800</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

The National Beverage balance sheet (Exhibit 12.3) indicates a $\mathbb{S}5{,}676$ decrease in prepaid expenses, which means that new cash prepayments are less than the amount of expenses. The decrease (the extra expenses) must be added to net income in Exhibit 12.4.  

## Change in Accounts Payable  

Cash flow from operations must reflect cash purchases, but not all purchases are for cash. Purchases on account increase accounts payable and cash paid to suppliers decreases accounts payable.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Accounts Payable (L)</td><td colspan="4">Accounts Payable (L)</td></tr><tr><td>Beg. bal.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Beg.</td><td>74,853</td></tr><tr><td>Cashpayments</td><td>Purchasesonaccount</td><td>Decrease</td><td>8,651</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>End.bal.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>End.</td><td>66,202</td></tr></table></body></html>  

National Beverage’s accounts payable decreased by $\Phi8{,}651$ , which means that cash payments were more than purchases on account. This decrease (the extra cash payments) must be subtracted in Exhibit 12.4. (An increase is added.)  

## Change in Accrued Expenses  

The income statement reflects all accrued expenses, but the cash flow statement must reflect actual payments for those expenses. Recording accrued expenses increases the balance in the liability accrued expenses and cash payments for the expenses decrease accrued expenses.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Accrued Expenses (L)</td><td colspan="2">Accrued Expenses (L)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Pay off accruals</td><td>Beg. bal.</td><td>Beg.</td><td>29,817</td></tr><tr><td>Accrued expenses</td><td>Increase</td><td>1,018</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>End.bal.</td><td>End.</td><td>30,835</td></tr></table></body></html>  

National Beverage’s accrued expenses (Exhibit 12.3) increased by $\mathbb{S}1{,}018$ which indicates that cash paid for the expenses is less than accrual basis expenses. The increase (the lower cash paid) must be added in Exhibit 12.4. (A decrease is subtracted.)  

## Summary  

We can summarize the typical additions and subtractions that are required to reconcile net income with cash flow from operating activities as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="3">Item</td><td colspan="2">ADDITIONSANDSUBTRACTIONS TORECONCILENETINCOMETOCASH FLOWFROMOPERATINGACTIVITIES</td></tr><tr><td>WhenItemIncreases</td><td>WhenItemDecreases</td></tr><tr><td>+</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Depreciationandamortization Gainonsaleoflong-termassets</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Lossonsaleoflong-termassets Accountsreceivable</td><td>+</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory</td><td></td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Prepaidexpenses</td><td></td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Accountspayable</td><td>+</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Accruedexpenseliabilities</td><td>+</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Notice again in this table that to reconcile net income to cash flow from operating activities, you must:  

•	 Add the change when an operating asset decreases or an operating liability increases.   
•	 Subtract the change when an operating asset increases or an operating liability decreases.  

The cash flow statement for National Beverage (Exhibit 12.1) shows the same additions and subtractions to reconcile net income to cash flow from operating activities described in Exhibit 12.4.  

## INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE  

## Classification of Interest on the Cash Flow Statement  

U.S. GAAP and IFRS differ in the cash flow statement treatment of interest received and interest paid as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>InterestReceived</td><td>InterestPaid</td></tr><tr><td>U.S.GAAP</td><td>Operating</td><td>Operating</td></tr><tr><td>IFRS</td><td>Operating orInvesting</td><td>Operating or Financing</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Under U.S. GAAP, interest paid and received are both classified as operating cash flows because the related revenue and expense enter into the computation of net income. This makes it easier to compare net income to cash flow from operations. It also benefits the financial statement user by ensuring comparability across companies. IFRS, on the other hand, allows interest received to be classified as either operating or investing and interest paid to be classified as either operating or financing. This recognizes that interest received results from investing activities, whereas interest paid, like dividends paid, involves payments to providers of financing. However, the alternative classifications may be confusing to financial statement readers.  

## Tip  

When preparing the indirect method operating section, (1) add operating asset decreases and operating liability increases, and (2) subtract operating asset increases and operating liability decreases.  

## P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K  

The indirect method for reporting cash flows from operating activities reports a conversion of net income to net cash flow from operating activities. The conversion involves additions and subtractions for (1) expenses (such as depreciation expense) and revenues that do not affect current assets or current liabilities and (2) changes in each of the individual current assets (other than cash and short-term investments) and current liabilities (other than short-term debt to financial institutions, current maturities of long-term debt, and dividends payable, which relate to financing), which reflect differences in the timing of accrual basis net income and cash flows.

## Interpreting Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

The operating activities section of the cash flow statement focuses attention on the firm’s ability to generate cash internally through operations and its management of operating assets and operating liabilities (also called operating working capital). Most analysts believe that this is the most important section of the statement because, in the long run, operations are the only source of cash. That is, investors will not invest in a company if they do not believe that cash generated from operations will be available to pay them dividends or expand the company. Similarly, creditors will not lend money if they do not believe that cash generated from operations will be available to pay back the loan. For example, many dot-com companies crashed when investors lost faith in their ability to turn business ideas into cash flows from operations.  

A common rule of thumb followed by financial and credit analysts is to avoid firms with rising net income but falling cash flow from operations. Rapidly rising inventories or receivables often predict a slump in profits and the need for external financing. A true understanding of the meaning of the difference requires a detailed understanding of its causes.  

In 2019, National Beverage reported that cash flow from operations was higher than net income. What caused this relationship? To answer these questions, we must carefully analyze how National Beverage’s operating activities are reported in its cash flow statement. To properly interpret this information, we also must learn more about the beverage industry. National Beverage normally reports higher cash flow from operations than net income because of the effect of depreciation and amortization, which reduces income but is not a cash outflow. At the same time, it carefully manages the assets and liabilities that enter into the operating cash flow calculation, keeping those total changes to a minimum. Many analysts compute the quality of income ratio as a general sign of the ability to generate cash through operations.

## INTERPRETATIONS  

In General The quality of income ratio measures the portion of income that was generated in cash. All other things equal, a higher quality of income ratio indicates greater ability to finance operating and other cash needs from operating cash inflows. A higher ratio also indicates that it is less likely that the company is using aggressive revenue recognition policies to increase net income, and therefore is less likely to experience a decline in earnings in the future. When this ratio does not equal 1.0, analysts must establish the sources of the difference to determine the significance of the findings. There are four potential causes of any difference:  

1.	 The corporate life cycle (growth or decline in sales). When sales are increasing, receivables and inventory normally increase faster than accounts payable. This often reduces operating cash flows below income, which, in turn, reduces the ratio. When sales are declining, the opposite occurs, and the ratio increases.  

2.	 Seasonality. Seasonal (from quarter to quarter) variations in sales and purchases of inventory can cause the ratio to deviate from 1.0 during particular quarters.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 12-3  

3.	 Changes in revenue and expense recognition. Aggressive revenue recognition or failure to accrue appropriate expenses will inflate net income and reduce the ratio.  

Analyze and interpret the quality of income ratio.  

4.	 Changes in management of operating assets and liabilities. Inefficient management will increase operating assets and decrease liabilities, reducing operating cash flows and the quality of income ratio. More efficient management, such as shortening of customer payment terms, will have the opposite effect.  

Focus Company Analysis During the past three years, National Beverage’s quality of income ratio has stayed relatively stable. Its ratio is below those of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. National Beverage’s lower ratio generally would be judged negatively by analysts and would prompt them to read the management’s discussion and analysis section of the annual report to determine its causes.

A Few Cautions The quality of income ratio can be interpreted based only on an understanding of the company’s business operations and strategy. For example, a low ratio for a quarter can be due simply to normal seasonal changes. However, it also can indicate obsolete inventory, slowing sales, or failed expansion plans. To test for these possibilities, analysts often analyze this ratio in tandem with the accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover ratios.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 12-4  

Report and interpret cash flows from investing activities.

As noted in earlier chapters, unethical managers sometimes attempt to reach earnings targets by manip ulating accruals and deferrals of revenues and expenses to inflate income. Because these adjusting entries do not affect the cash account, they have no effect on the cash flow statement. A growing difference between net income and cash flow from operations can be a sign of such manipulations. This early warn ing sign has signaled some famous bankruptcies, such as that of W. T. Grant in 1975. The company had inflated income by failing to make adequate accruals of expenses for uncollectible accounts receivable and obsolete inventory. The more astute analysts noted the growing difference between net income and cash flow from operations and recommended selling the stock long before the bankruptcy.  

## REPORTING AND INTERPRETING CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  

## Reporting Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

Preparing this section of the cash flow statement requires an analysis of the accounts related to property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and investments in the securities of other companies. Normally, the relevant balance sheet accounts include Short-Term Investments and long-term asset accounts such as Long-Term Investments and Property, Plant, and Equipment. The following relationships are the ones that you will encounter most frequently:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Related Balance Sheet Account(s)</td><td>InvestingActivity</td><td>Cash Flow Effect</td></tr><tr><td>Property,plant,andequipment and intangible assets (patents,etc.)</td><td>Purchase of property, plant, and equipment or intangibleassetsforcash</td><td>Outflow</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Short-orlong-terminvestments(stocks andbondsofothercompanies)</td><td>Saleofproperty,plant,andequipment or intangibleassetsforcash</td><td>Inflow</td></tr><tr><td>Purchaseofinvestmentsecuritiesforcash</td><td>Outflow</td></tr><tr><td>Sale(maturity)ofinvestmentsecuritiesforcash</td><td>Inflow</td></tr></table></body></html>

## EXHIBIT 12.5  

National Beverage Corp.: Schedule for Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities (dollars in thousands)  

In National Beverage’s case, the balance sheet (Exhibit 12.3) shows two investing assets (noted with an I) that have changed during the period: Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net, and Short-Term Investments. To determine the causes of these changes, accountants need to search the related company records.  

## Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net  

Analysis of National Beverage Corp.’s records reveals that the company purchased new property, plant, and equipment for $^{\mathbb{S}38,333}$ in cash, which is a cash outflow. The company also sold old equipment for $\mathbb{S}18$ in cash, an amount equal to its net book value. This is a cash inflow. These investing items are listed in the schedule of investing activities in Exhibit 12.5. These items, less the amount of depreciation and amortization expense added back in the Operations section $(\Phi13,444)$ , explain the increase in property, plant, and equipment, net, of $\mathbb{S}24{,}871$ .  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net (A)</td></tr><tr><td>Beginning</td><td>105,865</td><td>Sold 18</td></tr><tr><td>Purchased</td><td>38,333</td><td>Depreciation and amortization 13,444</td></tr><tr><td>Ending</td><td>130,736</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

## Investments  

National Beverage’s records indicate that it purchased $\mathbb{S}1{,}252$ in short-term investments during the year for cash, which is an investing cash outflow. The company also sold short-term investments for $\mathbb{S}3{,}685$ , an amount equal to their net book value. These investing items are listed in the schedule of investing activities in Exhibit 12.5. They explain the $\Phi2{,}433$ decrease in shortterm investments reported on the balance sheet. Changes in long-term investments would be treated in the same fashion.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Short-TermInvestments (A)</td></tr><tr><td>Beginning</td><td>5,347</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Purchased</td><td>1,252</td><td>Sold</td><td>3,685</td></tr><tr><td>Ending</td><td>2,914</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

The net cash flow from investing activities resulting from these four items is a $\mathbb{S}35{,}882$ outflow (see Exhibit 12.5).

## INTERPRETATIONS  

In General The capital acquisitions ratio reflects the portion of purchases of property, plant, and equipment financed from operating activities (without the need for outside debt or equity financing or the sale of other investments or fixed assets). A high ratio indicates less need for outside financing for current and future expansion. It benefits the company because it provides the company opportunities for strategic acquisitions, avoids the cost of additional debt, and reduces the risk of bankruptcy that comes with additional leverage (see Chapter 10).  

Focus Company Analysis National Beverage’s capital acquisitions ratio has decreased from 8.15 to 3.71 in recent years. It still generates more than sufficient cash to meet its investing needs. As a consequence, when credit markets tighten during a financial downturn, National Beverage’s investment plans are unaffected. National Beverage also has maintained a ratio that is higher than one of its larger competitors,  

PepsiCo, but lower than Coca-Cola’s.  

A Few Cautions Because the needs for investment in plant and equipment differ dramatically across industries (e.g., airlines versus pizza delivery restaurants), a particular firm’s ratio should be compared only with its prior years’ figures or with other firms in the same industry. Also, a high ratio may indicate a failure to update plant and equipment, which can limit a company’s ability to compete in the future.  

## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  

## Free Cash Flow  

Managers and analysts often calculate free cash $\mathbf{flow}^{8}$ as a measure of a firm’s ability to pursue long-term investment opportunities. Free cash flow is normally calculated as follows:  

Free Cash Flow $=$ Cash Flow from Operating Activities −  Dividends − Capital Expenditures  

Any positive free cash flow is available for additional capital expenditures, investments in other companies, and mergers and acquisitions without the need for external financing or reductions in dividends to shareholders. While free cash flow is considered a positive sign of financial flexibility, it also can represent a hidden cost to shareholders. Sometimes managers use free cash flow to pursue unprofitable investments just for the sake of growth or to obtain perquisites (such as fancy offices and corporate jets) that do not benefit the shareholders. In these cases, the shareholders would be better off if free cash flow were paid as additional dividends or used to repurchase the company’s stock on the open market.  

## REPORTING AND INTERPRETING CASH FLOWSFROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  

## Reporting Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

Financing activities are associated with generating capital from creditors and owners. This section of the cash flow statement reflects changes in two current liabilities, Notes Payable to Financial Institutions (often called short-term debt) and Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt, as well as changes in long-term liabilities and stockholders’ equity accounts. These balance sheet accounts relate to the issuance and retirement of debt and stock and the payment of dividends. The following relationships are the ones that you will encounter most frequently:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>RelatedBalanceSheetAccount(s)</td><td>Financing Activity</td><td>Cash Flow Effect</td></tr><tr><td>Short-termdebt(notespayable)</td><td>Borrowingcashfrombanks orotherfinancialinstitutions</td><td>Inflow</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Long-term debt</td><td>Repaymentofloanprincipal</td><td>Outflow</td></tr><tr><td>Issuanceofbondsforcash</td><td>Inflow</td></tr><tr><td>Repayment of bond principal</td><td>Outflow</td></tr><tr><td>Commonstockandadditional paid-in capital</td><td>Issuanceofstockforcash</td><td>Inflow</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Retainedearnings</td><td>Repurchase(retirement)of stockwith cash</td><td>Outflow</td></tr><tr><td>Paymentofcashdividends</td><td>Outflow</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remember that:  

•	 Cash repayments of principal are cash flows from financing activities.  

•	 Interest payments are cash flows from operating activities. Because interest expense is reported on the income statement, the related cash flow is shown in the operating section.  

•	 Dividend payments are cash flows from financing activities. Dividend payments are not reported on the income statement because they represent a distribution of income to owners. Therefore, they are shown in the financing section.  

•	 If debt or stock is issued for other than cash, it is not included in this section.  

To compute cash flows from financing activities, you should review changes in debt and stockholders’ equity accounts. In the case of National Beverage Corp., the analysis of changes in the balance sheet (Exhibit 12.3) finds that only long-term debt, common stock, and additional paid-in capital changed during the period (noted with an F) and retained earnings changed (noted with an F and an O).  

## Short- and Long-Term Debt  

When there is additional borrowing or principal repayments on long-term debt owed to financial institutions and investors, those amounts are financing cash flows. The appropriate amounts are determined by analyzing the long-term debt account. For 2019 the company repaid zero

If the company had borrowed or repaid short-term debt to financial institutions, it would be treated in the same fashion.  

## Common Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital  

National Beverage’s change in common stock and additional paid-in capital resulted from two decisions. National Beverage decided not to repurchase any outstanding stock during the year. But the company did issue common stock for $\mathbb{S}1{,}576$ in cash, which is a financing cash inflow.9 This accounts for the $\mathbb{S}1{,}576$ increase in common stock and additional paid-in capital. The amount is listed as an inflow in the schedule of financing activities in Exhibit 12.6.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">Common Stock (SE)</td><td colspan="3">Additional Paid-in Capital (SE)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Beginning</td><td>657</td><td></td><td>Beginning</td><td>18,358</td></tr><tr><td>Repurchase</td><td>Issue</td><td>1</td><td>Repurchase</td><td>Issue</td><td>1,575</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ending</td><td>658</td><td></td><td>Ending</td><td>19,933</td></tr></table></body></html>  

## Retained Earnings  

Finally, retained earnings should be analyzed. Retained earnings rise when income is earned and fall when dividends are declared and paid. National Beverage earned $\mathbb{S}140{,}853$ in income and paid $^{\S141,391}$ in dividends during 2019. National Beverage’s dividend payment is listed on the schedule of financing activities in Exhibit 12.6.

## Interpreting Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

The long-term growth of a company is normally financed from three sources: internally generated funds (cash from operating activities), the issuance of stock, and money borrowed on a long-term basis. As we discussed in Chapter 10, companies can adopt a number of different capital structures (the balance of debt and equity). The financing sources that management uses to fund growth will have an important impact on the firm’s risk and return characteristics. The statement of cash flows shows how management has elected to fund its growth. This information is used by analysts who wish to evaluate the capital structure and growth potential of a business.  

As we discussed, the investing section of the statement of cash flows includes cash payments to acquire fixed assets and short- and long-term investments and cash proceeds from the sale of fixed assets and short- and long-term investments. Cash inflows from financing activities include cash proceeds from the issuance of short- and long-term debt and common stock. Cash outflows include cash principal payments on short- and long-term debt, cash paid for the repurchase of the company’s stock, and cash dividend payments. Check your understanding of these concepts by answering the following questions before you move on.

## COMPLETING THE STATEMENT AND ADDITIONALDISCLOSURES  

## Statement Structure  

Refer to the formal statement of cash flows for National Beverage Corp. shown in Exhibit 12.1. As you can see, it is a simple matter to construct the statement after the detailed analysis of the accounts and transactions has been completed (shown in Exhibits 12.4, 12.5, and 12.6). Exhibit 12.7 summarizes the general structure of the statement for companies that use the indirect method for the operating section. When the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents is added to the cash and cash equivalents taken from the beginning-of-period amount on the balance sheet, it equals the end-of-period cash and cash equivalents amount reported on the balance sheet. Companies also must provide two other disclosures related to the cash flow statement.

## Supplemental Cash Flow Information  

Two additional required cash flow disclosures are normally listed at the bottom of the statement or in the notes.  

## Noncash Investing and Financing Activities  

Certain transactions are important investing and financing activities but have no cash flow effects. These are called noncash investing and financing activities. For example, the purchase of a $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ building with a $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ mortgage given by the former owner does not cause either an inflow or an outflow of cash. As a result, these noncash activities are not listed in the three main sections of the cash flow statement. However, supplemental disclosure of these transactions is required, in either narrative or schedule form. National Beverage’s statement of cash flows does not list any noncash investing and financing activities.  

## Cash Paid for Interest and Income taxes  

Companies that use the indirect method of presenting cash flows from operations also must provide two other figures: cash paid for interest and cash paid for income taxes.  

During an earlier year (ended April 30), National Beverage Corp. reported net income of $\mathbb{S}24,742$ (all numbers in thousands of dollars). The company also reported the following activities:  

a.	 Purchased equipment for $\mathbb{S}6{,}658$ in cash. d.	 Sold short-term investments for $\mathbb{S}112,450$ ,   
b.	 Disposed of equipment for $\mathbb{S}167$ in cash, its their net book value on the date of sale. net book value on the date of sale. $e_{\cdot}$ .	 Issued stock for $\mathbb{S}950$ in cash.

National Beverage reported positive profits and even higher cash flows from operations for the year. This difference between the two is caused primarily by decreases in prepaid expenses and depreciation. This also suggests that National Beverage is carefully managing its current assets and current liabilities so that it has more than sufficient cash on hand to cover the costs of purchases of additional equipment without the need to borrow additional funds. This cash can be used for future expansion or to pay future dividends to stockholders.  

## Chapter Supplement A  

Reporting Cash Flows from Operating Activities—Direct Method  

The direct method presents a summary of all operating transactions that result in either a debit or a credit to cash. It is prepared by adjusting each item on the income statement from an accrual basis to a cash basis. We will complete this process for all of the revenues and expenses reported in National Beverage’s income statement in Exhibit 12.3 and accumulate them in a new schedule in Exhibit 12.8.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Cash flows from operating activities (Direct method)</td></tr><tr><td>Cashcollectedfromcustomers</td><td>$1,013,624</td></tr><tr><td>Cash payments to suppliers</td><td>(648,188)</td></tr><tr><td>Cash payments for other expenses</td><td>(180,133)</td></tr><tr><td>Cash payments for interest</td><td>(202)</td></tr><tr><td>Cash payments for income taxes</td><td>(43,024)</td></tr><tr><td>Netcashprovidedbyoperatingactivities</td><td>142,077</td></tr></table></body></html>  

## EXHIBIT 12.8  

National Beverage Corp.: Schedule for Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities, Direct Method (dollars in thousands)  

## Converting Revenues to Cash Inflows  

When sales are recorded, accounts receivable increases, and when cash is collected, accounts receivable decreases. Thus, the following formula will convert sales revenue amounts from the accrual basis to the cash basis:  

![](images/3d3d8f8bfb65cf52d3ce8968bd140b24a6b91dbd7ce3826e7f3a198592791686.jpg)  

Using information from National Beverage’s income statement and balance sheet presented in Exhibit 12.3, we can compute cash collected from customers as follows:  

![](images/7b12563958b955cc1a39e03f7863d39d004d32915028467a8edd929326a8c98f.jpg)  

## Converting Cost of Goods Sold to Cash Paid to Suppliers  

Cost of goods sold represents the cost of merchandise sold during the accounting period. It may be more or less than the amount of cash paid to suppliers during the period. In National Beverage’s case, inventory increased during the year because the company bought more merchandise from suppliers than it sold to customers. If the company paid cash to suppliers of inventory, it must have paid more cash to suppliers than the amount of cost of goods sold, so the increase in inventory must be added to compute cash paid to suppliers.  

Typically, companies owe their suppliers money (an accounts payable balance will appear on the balance sheet). To convert cost of goods sold to cash paid to suppliers, the borrowing and repayments represented by the accounts payable also must be considered. Borrowing increases cash and accounts payable and repayment decreases cash and accounts payable, so National Beverage’s increase in accounts payable also must be subtracted in the computation. Cost of goods sold can therefore be converted to a cash basis in the following manner:  

![](images/8262a639ddd529d3e5394f5912b0af7df05d1590fb1ca32b310eb19c234fbbad.jpg)  

![](images/294140fec966b92158c816132cd269de0eb7a7b0ea4bbec2b693e117ff3b0ace.jpg)  

## Converting Operating Expenses to a Cash Outflow  

The total amount of an expense on the income statement may differ from the cash outflow associated with that activity. Some expenses are paid before they are recognized as expenses (e.g., prepaid rent). When prepayments are made, the balance in the asset prepaid expenses increases; when expenses are recorded, the balance in prepaid expenses decreases. When National Beverage’s prepaid expenses decreased by ${\mathfrak{s l}}_{,676}$ during the period, it paid less cash than it recorded as operating expenses. The decrease must be subtracted in computing cash paid for expenses.  

Some other expenses are paid for after they are recognized (e.g., accrued expenses). In this case, when expenses are recorded, the balance in the liability accrued expenses increases; when payments are made, the balance in accrued expenses decreases. When National Beverage’s accrued expenses increased by $^{\mathparagraph1,018}$ it paid less cash than it recorded as operating expenses. The increase must be subtracted in computing cash paid for expenses.  

Generally, other expenses can be converted from the accrual basis to the cash basis in the following manner:  

![](images/b6d77a53bdc76cfc9adeb1afff77abd3abb83f1bcafa13f88b0d6ebb91a3467c.jpg)  

Using information from Exhibit 12.3, we can compute cash paid for expenses for National Beverage as follows:  

![](images/bec1c0800d9d010f8c2e0b93f4c696edb63dd1a7406bea281801b242c6a68365.jpg)  

National Beverage also reports $\mathbb{S}202$ of interest expense.10 Because there is no interest payable balance, we can see that interest expense must be equal to cash payments for interest expense.  

Interest expense $\mathbb{S}202$ No changes in interest payable 0 Cash payments for interest \$202

It is important to note again that the net cash inflow or outflow is the same regardless of whether the direct or indirect method of presentation is used (in National Beverage’s case, an inflow of $\mathbf{\Phi5142,077})$ . The two methods differ only in terms of the details reported on the statement.

## Adjustment for Gains and Losses on Sale of Long-Term Assets—Indirect Method  

As noted earlier, the Operating Activities section of the cash flow statement prepared using the indirect method may include an adjustment for gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets reported on the income statement. As discussed in Chapter 8, when property, plant, and equipment is sold for more (less) than its net book value, a gain (loss) on disposal results. If property, plant, and equipment with an original cost of $\mathbb{S}10{,}000$ and accumulated depreciation of $\mathbb{S}4\mathrm{,}000$ is sold for $\mathbb{S}8{,}000$ cash, the following entry is made.

Accumulated depreciation +4,000   
Property, plant, and equipment −10,000  

The whole $\mathbb{S}8{,}000$ inflow of cash is an investing cash inflow, but the reported gain of $\mathbb{S}2{,}000$ also is shown on the income statement. Because the gain is included in the computation of income, it is necessary to remove (subtract) the $\mathbb{S}2{,}000$ gain from the Operating Activities section of the statement to avoid double counting.

Accumulated depreciation +4,000   
Property, plant, and equipment −10,000  

On the cash flow statement, the loss of $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ must be removed (added back) in the computation of cash from operating activities, and the total cash collected of $\mathbb{S}5{,}000$ must be shown in the investing activities section of the statement.

## T-Account Approach (Indirect Method)  

When we began our discussion of preparing the statement of cash flows, we noted that changes in cash must equal the sum of the changes in all other balance sheet accounts. Based on this idea, we used the following three steps to prepare the statement of cash flows:  

1.	 Determine the change in each balance sheet account. From this year’s ending balance, subtract this year’s beginning balance (i.e., last year’s ending balance). 2.	 Identify the cash flow category or categories to which each account relates. 3.	 Create schedules that summarize operating, investing, and financing cash flows.  

Instead of creating separate schedules for each section of the statement, many accountants prefer to prepare a single large T-account to represent the changes that have taken place in cash subdivided into the three sections of the cash flow statement. Such an account is presented in Panel A of Exhibit 12.9. The

cash account in Panel A shows increases in cash as debits and decreases in cash as credits. Note how each section matches the three schedules that we prepared for National Beverage’s cash flows presented in Exhibits 12.4, 12.5, and 12.6. Panel B includes the same T-accounts for the noncash balance sheet accounts we used in our discussion of each cash flow statement section in the body of the chapter. Note how each change in the noncash balance sheet accounts has a number referencing the change in the cash account that it accompanies. The statement of cash flows presented in Exhibit 12.1 can be prepared in proper format based on the information in the cash flow T-account.  

## C H A P T E R  T A K E - A W A Y S  

12-1.	Classify cash flow statement items as part of net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. p. 628  

The cash flow statement has three main sections: Cash Flows from Operating Activities, which are related to earning income from normal operations; Cash Flows from Investing Activities, which are related to the acquisition and sale of productive assets; and Cash Flows from Financing Activities, which are related to external financing of the enterprise. The net cash inflow or outflow for the year is the same amount as the increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year on the balance sheet. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  

12-2.	Report and interpret cash flows from operating activities using the indirect method. p. 635  

The indirect method for reporting cash flows from operating activities reports a conversion of net income to net cash flow from operating activities. The conversion involves additions and subtractions for (1) noncurrent accruals, including expenses (such as depreciation expense) and revenues that do not affect operating assets or operating liabilities, and (2) changes in each of the individual operating assets (other than cash) and operating liabilities, which reflect differences in the timing of accrual basis net income and cash flows.  

The quality of income ratio (Cash Flow from Operating Activities $\div$ Net Income) measures the portion of income that was generated in cash. A higher quality of income ratio indicates greater ability to finance operating and other cash needs from operating cash inflows. A higher ratio also indicates that it is less likely that the company is using aggressive revenue recognition policies to increase net income.  

12-4.	Report and interpret cash flows from investing activities. p. 642  

Investing activities reported on the cash flow statement include cash payments to acquire fixed assets, intangibles, and short- and long-term investments and cash proceeds from the sale of fixed assets, intangibles, and short- and long-term investments.  

12-5.	Analyze and interpret the capital acquisitions ratio. p. 644  

The capital acquisitions ratio (Cash Flow from Operating Activities $\div$ Cash Paid for Property, Plant, and Equipment) reflects the portion of purchases of property, plant, and equipment financed from operating activities without the need for outside debt or equity financing or the sale of other investments or fixed assets. A high ratio benefits the company because it provides the company with oppor tunities for strategic acquisitions.  

12-6.	Report and interpret cash flows from financing activities. p. 645  

Cash inflows from financing activities include cash proceeds from the issuance of short- and longterm debt and common stock. Cash outflows include cash principal payments on short- and longterm debt, cash paid for the repurchase of the company’s stock, and cash dividend payments. Cash payments associated with interest are a cash flow from operating activities.  

12-7.	Understand the format of the cash flow statement and additional cash flow disclosures. p. 647  

The statement of cash flows splits transactions that affect cash into three categories: Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities. The operating section is most often prepared using the indirect method that begins with Net Income and adjusts the amount to eliminate noncash transactions. Noncash investing and financing activities are investing and financing activities that do not involve cash. They include, for example, purchases of fixed assets with long-term debt or stock, exchanges of fixed assets, and exchanges of debt for stock. These transactions are disclosed only as supplemental disclosures to the cash flow statement, along with cash paid for taxes and interest when using the indirect method.  

Throughout the preceding chapters, we emphasized the conceptual basis of accounting. An understanding of the rationale underlying accounting is important for both preparers and users of financial statements. In Chapter 13, we bring together our discussion of the major users of financial statements and how they analyze and use these statements. We discuss and illustrate many widely used analytical techniques discussed in earlier chapters, as well as additional techniques. As you study Chapter 13, you will see that an understanding of accounting rules and concepts is essential for effective analysis of financial statements.

## Making a Decision as a Financial Analyst: Analyzing Cash Flow for a New Company  

Carlyle Golf, Inc., was formed in September of last year. The company designs, contracts for the manufacture of, and markets a line of men’s golf apparel. A portion of the statement of cash flows for Carlyle follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">CURRENTYEAR</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flows from operating activities Netincome Depreciation Noncash compensation(stock) Deposits with suppliers Increaseinprepaid assets Increasein accountspayable 81,765 Increaseinaccruedliabilities Netcashflowsfromoperating activities</td><td>$(460,089) 3,554 254,464 (404,934) (42,260) 24,495 $(543,005)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Management expects a solid increase in sales in the near future. To support the increase in sales, it plans to add $\mathbb{S}2.2$ million to inventory. The company did not disclose a sales forecast. At the end of the current year, Carlyle had less than $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ in cash. It is not unusual for a new company to experience a loss and negative cash flows during its start-up phase.  

Required:  

As a financial analyst recently hired by a major investment bank, you have been asked to write a short memo to your supervisor evaluating the problems facing Carlyle. Emphasize typical sources of financing that may or may not be available to support the expansion.  

## Critical Thinking Case  

## CP12-6  

LO12-1, 12-2, 12-6 Enron  

## Ethical Decision Making: A Real-Life Example  

In February 19, 2004, press release, the Securities and Exchange Commission described a number of fraudulent transactions that Enron executives concocted in an effort to meet the company’s financial targets. One particularly well-known scheme is called the “Nigerian barge” transaction, which took place in the fourth quarter of 1999. According to court documents, Enron arranged to sell three electricitygenerating power barges moored off the coast of Nigeria. The “buyer” was the investment banking firm of Merrill Lynch. Although Enron reported this transaction as a sale in its income statement, it turns out this was no ordinary sale. Merrill Lynch didn’t really want the barges and had only agreed to buy them because Enron guaranteed, in a secret side deal, that it would arrange for the barges to be bought back from Merrill Lynch within six months of the initial transaction. In addition, Enron promised to pay Merrill Lynch a hefty fee for doing the deal. In an interview on National Public Radio on August 17, 2002, Michigan Senator Carl Levin declared, “(T)he case of the Nigerian barge transaction was, by any definition, a loan.”  

## Required:  

1.	 Discuss whether the Nigerian barge transaction should have been considered a loan rather than a sale. As part of your discussion, consider the following questions. Doesn’t the Merrill Lynch payment to Enron at the time of the initial transaction automatically make it a sale, not a loan? What aspects of the transaction are similar to a loan? Which aspects suggest that the four criteria for revenue recognition (summarized near the end of Chapter 3) were not fulfilled?  

2.	 The income statement effect of recording the transaction as a sale rather than a loan is fairly clear: Enron was able to boost its revenues and net income. What is somewhat less obvious, but nearly as important, are the effects on the statement of cash flows. Describe how recording the transaction as a sale rather than as a loan would change the statement of cash flows.  

3.	 How would the two different statements of cash flows (described in your response to requirement 2) affect financial statement users?
