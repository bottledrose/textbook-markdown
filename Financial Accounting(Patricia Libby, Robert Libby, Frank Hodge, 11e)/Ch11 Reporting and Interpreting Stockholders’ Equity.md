# Ch11 Reporting and Interpreting Stockholders’ Equity  

Microsoft Corporation’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. To do so, Microsoft focuses on helping companies reinvent and improve their business processes, by building on being one of the two largest providers of cloud computing services, and by expanding the use of personal computers around the world. Microsoft has also stated ambitious sustainability goals. The first goal is for its operations to be carbon negative by 2030. The second goal is for the company to have removed from the environment all the carbon it has emitted since it was founded almost 50 years ago. Can the company achieve these goals? Time will tell, but with revenues in 2020 of $\Phi143$ billion and total assets of $\Phi301$ billion, the company has the resources to be ambitious and the desire to drive change. Microsoft discusses its commitment to building a more sustainable future in the ESG Reporting box below. In this chapter, we study the role that stockholders’ equity plays in funding a business and the strategies that managers use to maximize stockholders’ wealth.  

## UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS  

To some people, the words corporation and business are almost synonymous. You’ve probably heard friends refer to a career in business as “the corporate world.” Equating business with corporations is understandable because corporations are the dominant form of business organization in terms of volume of operations. If you were to write the names of 10 familiar businesses on a piece of paper, probably all of them would be corporations.

## ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, & GOVERNANCE (ESG) REPORTING  

## Microsoft  

On its official blog, Microsoft publicly commits to a more sustainable future by stating “Solving our planet’s carbon issues will require technology that does not exist today. That’s why a significant part of our endeavor involves putting Microsoft’s balance sheet to work to stimulate and accelerate the development of carbon removal technology. Our new Climate Innovation Fund will commit to invest $\mathbb{S}1$ billion over the next four years into new technologies and expand access to capital around the world to people working to solve this problem. We understand that this is just a fraction of the investment needed, but our hope is that it spurs more governments and companies to invest in new ways as well.”  

ISSUING AND REPORTING STOCK  

Microsoft’s stock is traded on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) Stock Market under the symbol MSFT. As of July 27, 2020, Microsoft had just under 92,000 registered holders of its common stock.  

The popularity of the corporate form can be attributed to a critical advantage that corporations have over sole proprietorships and partnerships: They can raise large amounts of capital because both large and small investors easily can participate in their ownership. This ease of participation is related to several factors.  

•  Shares of stock can be purchased in small amounts. You could buy a single share of Microsoft stock for about $^{\Phi220}$ and become one of the owners of this successful company.   
Ownership interests can be transferred easily through the sale of shares on established markets such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, where Microsoft’s stock is traded.

•  Stock ownership provides investors with limited liability. In the event of bankruptcy, creditors have claims against only the corporation’s assets, not the assets of the individual owners.  

Many Americans own stock either directly or indirectly through a mutual fund or pension program. Stock ownership offers them the opportunity to earn higher returns than they could depositing money in a bank account or investing in corporate bonds. Unfortunately, stock ownership also involves risks. The appropriate balance between risk and the expected return on an investment depends on individual preferences.  

Exhibit 11.1 presents financial information from Microsoft’s annual report.  

Notice that the stockholders’ equity section of Microsoft’s balance sheet lists two primary sources of equity:  

1.	 Contributed capital from the sale of stock. This is the amount of money stockholders invested through the purchase of shares. For Microsoft, contributed capital is the amount in the Common Stock and paid-in capital accounts $^{1}\mathbb{S}80{,}552$ million for fiscal 2020).   
2.	 Earned capital generated by the company’s profit-making activities. Earned capital is kept track of in the Retained Earnings account (referred to as an “accumulated deficit” when negative). Retained earnings is the cumulative amount of net income the corporation has earned since it organized as a corporation, less the cumulative amount of dividends paid since it organized.

ORGANIZATION OF THE CHAPTER  

## OWNERSHIP OF A CORPORATION  

The corporation is the only business form the law recognizes as a separate entity. As a distinct entity, the corporation enjoys a continuous existence separate and apart from its owners. It may own assets, incur liabilities, expand and contract in size, sue others, be sued, and enter into contracts independently of its stockholder owners.  

To protect everyone’s rights, the creation and governance of corporations are tightly regulated by law. Corporations are created by application to a state government (not the federal government). Corporations are governed by a board of directors elected by the stockholders.  

Each state has different laws governing the organization of corporations created within its boundaries. Microsoft incorporated in the state of Washington and has its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. You will find that an unusually large number of corporations are incorporated in Delaware even though their headquarters are located in a different state. Companies choose Delaware for incorporation because the state has some of the most favorable tax laws for corporations.  

## Benefits of Stock Ownership  

When you invest in a corporation, you are known as a stockholder or shareholder. As a stockholder, you receive shares of stock that you subsequently can sell on established stock exchanges. Owners of common stock receive a number of benefits:  

•	 A voice in management. You may vote in the stockholders’ meeting on major issues concerning management of the corporation.   
•	 Dividends. If a company pays dividends, you receive a proportional share of the distribution of profits.   
•	 Residual claim. You will receive a proportional share of the distribution of remaining assets upon the liquidation of the company.  

Stockholders, unlike creditors, are able to vote at the annual stockholders’ meeting. Each share of stock typically represents one vote. The following notice of the annual meeting of stockholders, referred to as a proxy statement, was recently sent to all owners of Microsoft stock:

REAL WORLD EXCERPT: Notice of Stockholders’ Meeting  

The  proxy  statement  also  contained  information  concerning  the  people  who  were nominated to be members of the board of directors as well as detailed information about executive compensation and the audit fees charged by Deloitte & Touche. Because most stockholders do not actually attend the annual meeting, the notice included information about how absentee stockholders can mail their votes in or cast their votes using the Internet or a telephone.  

Stockholders have ultimate authority in a corporation. The board of directors and, indirectly, all employees are accountable to the stockholders.  

## Authorized, Issued, and Outstanding Shares  

A company’s corporate charter specifies the maximum number of shares the company is authorized to sell to the public. This maximum is referred to as the number of authorized shares. The shares a company has actually sold to the public represent the number of issued shares. For reasons we discuss later, a company might want to buy back shares that have already been sold to the public. Shares that have been bought back can be retired or held as treasury stock. Shares held as treasury stock are considered issued shares but not outstanding shares. Outstanding shares represent the total number of shares owned by stockholders on any particular date. Thus, when a company buys back shares and holds them as treasury stock, it creates a difference between the number of issued shares and the number of outstanding shares of its stock. Shares that are retired resume a status of being authorized but not issued.  

Recall that Microsoft is incorporated in Washington State. Washington State is one of a small number of states that do not allow treasury stock, so Microsoft retires all shares that it repurchases each year. In fiscal 2020, Microsoft reports in its notes to its financial statements that it repurchased and retired 126 million shares of common stock. Since those shares are not listed as treasury stock, Microsoft’s number of outstanding shares is equal to its number of issued shares. When this is the case, companies typically only list the number of outstanding shares on their balance sheets. You can see this for Microsoft in Exhibit 11.1. The information reported in Exhibit 11.1 is summarized below:  

![](images/78e33889247f5473244c7827735b58b355525797eb67934a01cccbd0116ad540.jpg)

Knowing the number of shares outstanding is important because this number is used in the calculation of various ratios, including the earnings per share ratio.  

## Earnings per Share (EPS)  

## ANALYTICAL QUESTION  

How well is a company performing?  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 11-2  

Compute and analyze the earnings per share ratio.  

## RATIO AND COMPARISONS  

Earnings per share is computed as follows:  

Earnings per Share $=$ Net Income $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{~\div~}}$ Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding \*Any preferred dividends (discussed later in this chapter) should be subtracted from net income.  

The 2020 ratio for Microsoft:

In General You probably have seen newspaper headlines announcing a company’s earnings. Notice that those news stories normally report earnings on an earnings per share (EPS) basis. EPS is a popular measure because it emphasizes the amount of earnings attributable to a single share of outstanding common stock. Because the number of outstanding shares of common stock changes over time, and is different across firms, using EPS rather than just net income allows analysts and investors to make “profitability per share” comparisons across time and across firms. Companies are required to report EPS on their income statements.  

Focus Company Analysis For Microsoft, net income has increased over the last three years while the weighted average number of common shares outstanding has remained relatively constant. This has caused the company’s EPS to increase over the three years. Relative to its competitors, Microsoft’s 2020 EPS ratio is less than IBM’s ratio but greater than Intel’s ratio. We can compare EPS numbers across firms of different sizes because EPS captures the amount of earnings attributable to a single share of outstanding common stock, regardless of the size of a company or the number of shares of stock outstanding.  

A Few Cautions While EPS is an effective and widely used measure of profitability per share, it does not necessarily indicate how a company will perform in the future. Stock price is a better indication of expected future performance. For example, if two companies have identical EPS numbers, but the stock price of one company is double that of the other company, investors expect greater future performance from the firm with the higher stock price. EPS is a measure of performance per share of stock over a prior period, while stock price is an indication of expected performance over future periods. It is important to keep this in mind when analyzing EPS numbers across time and across firms.  

## COMMON STOCK TRANSACTIONS  

All corporations issue common stock, and some elect to issue a second type of stock called preferred stock. In this section, we discuss common stock. Near the end of the chapter, we discuss preferred stock.  

Common stock is held by investors who are the “owners” of a corporation. Though stockholders are owners and have the right to vote and share in the profitability of the business through dividends, they do not actively participate in managing the business. Instead, they elect a board of directors and it is the board’s role to hire and monitor executives who manage a company’s activities on a day-to-day basis.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 11-3  

Describe the characteristics of common stock and report common stock transactions.  

Depending on state law, a company’s common stock may be required to have a par value, a nominal value per share established in the corporate charter. Par value has no relationship to the market value of a stock. For example, Microsoft’s common stock has a par value of \$0.00000625 per share while its stock price is over $\mathbb{S}220$ per share.  

The original purpose of assigning a par value to a share of common stock was to protect creditors by specifying a permanent amount of capital that owners could not withdraw before a bankruptcy, which would leave creditors with something in the event that a company did not succeed. This permanent amount of capital is called legal capital. Though the requirement to assign a par value and maintain legal capital is embedded in state law, in today’s business world it does little to protect creditors. Like Microsoft, companies have simply transitioned to assigning an extremely low par value. Many companies assign a par value of $\mathbb{S}0.01$ per share, which means that any legal capital requirements are too low to meaningfully protect creditors. As a result, creditors have adopted other protection mechanisms, like the debt covenants we discussed in Chapter 10, to provide some protection in the event that a company performs poorly. There are some states that require the issuance of no-par value stock. When a corporation issues no-par stock, legal capital is defined by state law.  

## Initial Sale of Stock  

An initial public offering, or IPO, involves the very first sale of a company’s stock to the public (i.e., when the company first “goes public”). You have probably heard stories of a new company’s stock price increasing dramatically the day of its IPO. While investors sometimes earn significant returns on IPOs, they also take significant risks. Once a company’s stock has been traded on established markets, additional sales of new stock to the public are called seasoned offerings.  

Most sales of stock to the public are cash transactions. To illustrate the accounting for an initial sale of stock, assume that Microsoft sold 1 million shares of its $\mathbb{5}0.00000625$ par value stock for $\mathbb{S}220$ per share. The company would record the following journal entry:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Cash (+A) (1,000,000 × $220)</td><td>220,000,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Common stock(+SE)（1,000,000×$0.00000625)</td><td></td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Additionalpaid-incapital(+SE)</td><td></td><td>219,999,994</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Assets Liabilities</td><td colspan="2">Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Cash +220,000,000 Commonstock +6 Additionalpaid-incapital +219,999,994</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Notice that the Common Stock account is credited for the number of shares sold times the par value per share. The Additional Paid-in Capital account is credited for the remainder, which is the amount “in addition” to par value that the company received when it issued the shares. In rare cases, a corporate charter may specify a “stated value” rather than a “par value.” For accounting purposes, the two values are used in the same way. If there is no par or stated value, the entire proceeds from the sale will be entered in the Common Stock account.  

## Sale of Stock in Secondary Markets  

When a company sells stock to the public, the transaction is between the issuing corporation and the investor. Subsequent to the initial sale, investors can sell shares to other investors without directly affecting the corporation. For example, if investor Ed deHaan sold 1,000 shares of Microsoft stock to investor Amanda Winn, Microsoft would not record a journal entry. Mr. deHaan received cash for the shares he sold, and Ms. Winn received stock for the cash she paid. Microsoft was not a part of the transaction and therefore did not receive or pay anything.  

Each business day, The Wall Street Journal reports the results of thousands of transactions between investors in secondary markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ market. Stockholders expect to earn money on their investments through dividends if a company pays dividends and through increases in a company’s stock price. In many instances, senior management has been replaced because of a stock’s poor performance in the stock market.  

## Stock Issued for Employee Compensation  

One of the advantages of the corporate form is the ability to separate the management of a business from its ownership. Separation also can be a disadvantage because some managers may not act in the owners’ best interests. This potential problem can be addressed in a number of ways. For example, compensation packages can be developed to reward employees for meeting goals that are important to stockholders. Another strategy is to offer employees stock, either directly through stock awards or indirectly through stock options. Stock awards grant shares of stock to employees that vest on future dates. Stock options give employees the right to buy stock in the future at a fixed price. Both stock awards and stock options provide an incentive for employees to take actions that increase a company’s stock price, thereby aligning their interests with the interests of stockholders. Microsoft uses equity compensation to incentivize its executives and explains why in the following disclosure:  

![](images/b8740a65c0d3a5269eb015418461fa1cc1b58f05b0c2e2ef8a3d586a9f8dd92f.jpg)

## PAY MIX  

At least 70 percent of the annual target compensation opportunity for our Named Executives is equity-based to incentivize a long-term focus and align their interests with those of our shareholders. Our Compensation Committee structures the pay mix for our annual target total compensation opportunities to place a higher proportion in equity awards than the companies in our compensation peer group.

REAL WORLD EXCERPT Equity Compensation  

## Repurchase of Stock  

A corporation may want to repurchase its stock from existing stockholders for a number of reasons. One common reason is the existence of an employee bonus plan that provides workers with shares of the company’s stock as part of their compensation. Because of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations concerning newly issued shares, most companies find it less costly to give employees repurchased shares than to issue new ones. In addition, if a company were to pay bonuses with newly issued shares each period, it would increase the number of shares in the market, which would decrease the company’s stock price. Increasing the number of shares also would dilute existing stockholders’ investments, as each share of stock they own would be worth less. By repurchasing shares to fulfill bonus obligations, companies avoid this dilutive effect. As discussed earlier, stock that has been repurchased and is held by the issuing corporation is called treasury stock. Treasury shares have no voting, dividend, or other stockholder rights while they are held as treasury stock.  

When companies repurchase shares from the market, they pay cash and receive their own stock. Since Microsoft is required by Washington State law to retire shares it repurchases, let’s assume that a competitor, IBM, repurchased 100,000 shares of its stock in the open market when it was selling for $\mathbb{S}140$ per share. To reflect the repurchase, the company would record the following journal entry:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Treasury stock(+XSE,-SE)(100,000× $140)</td><td>14,000,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash(-A) sh -14,000,000</td><td>Treasurystock</td><td>14,000,000 -14,000,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Assets Liabilities + Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"></td></tr></table></body></html>  

Intuitively, many students expect the Treasury Stock account to be reported as an asset. Such is not the case because a company cannot own itself. The Treasury Stock account is therefore a contra-equity account, which is why Treasury Stock is shown as a negative number on a company’s balance sheet. This practice makes sense because treasury stock is considered issued but not outstanding. Thus, when stock is repurchased and held in treasury, it is not removed from the Common Stock account but rather is shown as its own separate account within stockholders’ equity, and because repurchasing the shares reduced assets (cash), it reduces equity. As the information in Exhibit 11.2 indicates, IBM reported treasury stock in the amount of $^{\Phi169,339}$ million on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.  

Before concluding this section, let’s revisit Microsoft and the retirement of repurchased shares. When a company repurchases shares and retires them, it records the outflow of cash paid for the shares and removes the exact amounts that were added to common stock and additiona

paid-in capital when the stock was originally issued. The journal entry also involves increasing an additional paid-in capital account or decreasing retained earnings, depending on whether the shares were repurchased at a price lower or higher than the original share price. Accounting for share retirements is covered in more detail in advanced accounting courses.  

When a company sells its treasury stock, it does not report an accounting profit or loss on the transaction, even if it sells the stock for more or less than it originally cost to repurchase the shares. GAAP does not permit a corporation to report income or losses from investments in its own stock because transactions with the owners are not considered normal profit-making activities. Based on the previous example, assume that IBM reissues 10,000 shares of treasury stock for $\mathbb{S}150$ per share. Remember that the company had repurchased the shares for $\mathbb{S}140$ per share. Because the reissue price $\mathbf{\bar{\mathbb{S}}150}$ per share) is higher than the repurchase price ( $\mathbb{S}140$ per share), stockholders’ equity would increase by $\mathbb{S}10$ per reissued share, or $^{\S100,000}$ total (10,000 shares $\times\ \mathbb{S}10^{"}$ ). IBM would record the following journal entry when it reissues the shares:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Cash (+A) (10,000 × $150)</td><td>1,500,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Treasury stock (-XSE,+SE)(10,000 × $140)</td><td></td><td>1,400,000</td></tr><tr><td>Additional paid-in capital (+SE)</td><td></td><td>100,000</td></tr></table></body></html>

If the treasury stock had been reissued at $\mathbb{S}130$ per share, stockholders’ equity would decrease by $\mathbb{S}10$ per reissued share, or $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ total (10,000 shares $\times\,\mathfrak{S}10^{'}$ ). The $\mathbb{S}10$ is the difference between the reissue price $\mathbb{S}130$ per share) and the repurchase price $\mathbb{S}140$ per share). The journal entry IBM would record if the reissue price were $\mathbb{S}130$ per share is:

## DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK  

The return from investing in a company’s common stock can come from two sources: stock price appreciation and dividends. Some investors prefer to buy stocks that pay little or no dividends because companies that reinvest the majority of their earnings back into their operations tend to increase their future earnings potential, along with their stock price. Wealthy investors in high tax brackets prefer to receive their return in the form of higher stock prices because capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate than dividend income. Other investors, such as those who are retired and need a steady income, prefer to receive their return in the form of dividends. These investors often seek stocks that will pay relatively high dividends, such as utility stocks. Because of the importance of dividends to many investors, analysts often compute the dividend yield ratio to evaluate a company’s dividend policy.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 11-5  

Compute and analyze the dividend yield ratio.  

## KEY RATIO ANALYSIS  

## Dividend Yield  

## ANALYTICAL QUESTION  

How much does a company pay out in dividends each year relative to its share price?  

## RATIO AND COMPARISONS  

The dividend yield ratio is computed as follows:  

Dividend Yield $=$ Dividends per Share $\div$ Market Price per Share  

The 2020 ratio for Microsoft: $\mathbb{5}2.04\div\mathbb{5}202.49=1.01\%$

## INTERPRETATIONS  

In General Individuals who invest in the common stock of a company can earn a return from both dividends and capital appreciation (increases in the market price of the stock). The dividend yield ratio reflects the return on investment absent any capital appreciation or, said differently, the return attributed solely to the dividends a company pays.  

Focus Company Analysis Microsoft’s stock price at the end of fiscal 2020 was $\mathbb{S}202.49\$ . If you had invested this amount in Microsoft and received the dividends that Microsoft paid out during 2020, your return attributable to dividends would have been 1.01 percent. Even though Microsoft has increased its dividend over the last three years (from $\mathbb{S}1.68$ in 2018 to $\mathbb{S}2.04\$ in 2020), its dividend yield ratio has declined. This decline is driven by the significant increase in Microsoft’s stock price from $\mathbb{S}95.37$ at the end of fiscal 2018 to $\mathbb{S}202.49\$ at the end of fiscal 2020. In addition to a declining dividend yield ratio over time, Microsoft’s dividend yield ratio falls below that of two of its competitors: IBM’s dividend yield ratio is 5.24 percent and Intel’s dividend yield ratios is 2.82 percent.  

A Few Cautions Remember that the dividend yield ratio tells only part of the return on investment story; it does not reflect capital appreciation as reflected in the increase in a company’s stock price over time. Often potential capital appreciation is a much more important consideration for investors. Though Micro soft pays a dividend, it also reinvests a portion of each year’s earnings back into operations to fuel growth. Analysts should consider a company’s dividend yield ratio in conjunction with other return measures when assessing a company’s performance.  

## Key Dividend Dates  

The declaration and payment of a dividend involve several key dates. Let’s review these dates based on information reported on Microsoft’s Investor Relations website.

This excerpt contains three important dates:  

1.	Declaration date. The declaration date is the date on which the board of directors officially approves the dividend. As soon as the board declares a dividend, a liability is created and must be recorded.  

2.	Date of record. The record date follows the declaration date; it is the date on which the corporation prepares the list of current stockholders who will receive the dividend payment. The dividend is payable only to those names listed on the record date. No journal entry is made on this date.  

3.	Date of payment. The payment date is the date on which cash is disbursed to pay the dividend liability.  

##  

A company records a journal entry on the declaration date and the date of payment. No journal entry is recorded on the date of record.  

These three dates apply to all cash dividends and can be shown graphically as follows:  

![](images/2c10c56a4705d8b6a420dd3483eb569c228364aaa99ff4e00770282d443a5a39.jpg)  

On the declaration date, a company records a liability related to the dividend. To illustrate, on September 18, 2019, Microsoft records the following journal entry. The $\mathbb{S}3{,}886$ million was reported by Microsoft in its second-quarter earnings press release.  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Retained earnings (-SE)</td><td>3,886,000,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dividends payable (+L) Liabilities</td><td>+</td><td>3,886,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td colspan="2">Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>

Dividends payable +\$3,886,000,000 Retained earnings −\$3,886,000,000  

The payment of the liability on December 12 is recorded as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Dividends payable (-L)</td><td>3,886,000,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash (-A) Assets</td><td>+</td><td>3,886,000,000 Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Liabilities</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Cash −\$3,886,000,000 Dividends payable −\$3,886,000,000  

Notice that the declaration and payment of a cash dividend reduce assets (cash) and stockholders’ equity (retained earnings) by the same amount. This observation explains the two fundamental requirements for payment of a cash dividend:  

1.	Sufficient retained earnings or net income. The corporation must have accumulated a sufficient amount of retained earnings, or earned a sufficient amount of income during the period, to cover the amount of the dividend.   
2.	Sufficient cash. The corporation must have sufficient cash to pay the dividend and meet the operating needs of the business. The mere fact that the Retained Earnings account has a large credit balance does not mean that the board of directors can declare and pay a cash dividend. The cash generated in the past by earnings represented in the Retained Earnings account may have been spent to acquire inventory, buy operational assets, and pay liabilities. Consequently, no necessary relationship exists between the balance of retained earnings and the balance of cash on any particular date. Quite simply, retained earnings is not cash.  

Investors should be careful to research a company’s dividend policy before investing. In the United States, regardless of how profitable a company is, there is no legal obligation for companies to declare dividends. Many very successful companies have never paid dividends while other equally successful companies pay out a large percentage of their earnings each year as a dividend.  

The dividend policy for a company is determined by the board of directors. In some other countries, dividend payments are not discretionary and are required by law. In Brazil, for example, companies are legally required to pay out at least 25 percent of their net income in dividends each year.  

While U.S. companies are under no legal obligation to declare dividends, once the board of directors declares a dividend (i.e., creates a dividend payable), there is a legal obligation to pay that dividend. In the case of a corporate bankruptcy, dividends payable would be a legally enforceable claim against the company.  

## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  

## Impact of Dividends on Stock Price  

Another date that is important in understanding dividends has no accounting implications. The date one business day before the date of record is known as the ex-dividend date. This date is established by the stock exchanges to account for the fact that it takes time to officially transfer stock from a seller to a buyer. If you buy stock before the ex-dividend date, you will be listed as the owner on the date of record and will receive the dividend. If you buy stock on the ex-dividend date or later, the previous owner will be listed as the owner on the date of record and will therefore receive the dividend.  

If you follow stock prices, you will notice that they often fall on the exdividend date. The stock is worth less on that date because it no longer includes the right to receive the next dividend.

## STOCK DIVIDENDS AND STOCK SPLITS  

## Stock Dividends  

Unless stated otherwise, the term dividend means a cash dividend. Though cash dividends are by far the most common type of dividend, companies also can distribute additional shares of stock as a dividend. A stock dividend is a distribution of additional shares of a company’s own stock to its stockholders on a pro rata basis at no cost to the stockholder.  

![](images/d67545672a3e9e9448bcf90fd4b821939cd64d9b9de4a9ea366a94c683834589.jpg)

The phrase pro rata basis means that each stockholder receives additional shares equal to the percentage of shares held. A stockholder with 10 percent of the outstanding shares would receive 10 percent of any additional shares issued as a stock dividend.  

The economic value of a stock dividend is the subject of much debate. In reality, a stock dividend by itself has no economic value. All stockholders receive a pro rata distribution of shares, which means that each stockholder owns exactly the same portion of the company as before. The value of an investment is determined by the percentage of the company a stockholder owns, not by the number of shares held. If you get change for a dollar, you do not have more wealth because you hold four quarters instead of one dollar. Similarly, if you own 10 percent of a company, you are not wealthier simply because the company declares a stock dividend and gives you (and all other stockholders) more shares of stock. Both before and after the stock dividend, you own 10 percent of the company.  

The stock market reacts immediately when a stock dividend is issued, and the stock price falls. Theoretically, if the stock price was $\updownarrow60$ before a stock dividend and the company doubles the number of shares outstanding by issuing a stock dividend, the price of the company’s stock should fall to $\mathbb{S}30$ . In reality, the fall in price may not be exactly proportional to the number of new shares issued. In some cases, the stock dividend makes the stock more attractive to new investors. Many investors prefer to buy stock in round lots, typically in multiples of 100 shares. An investor with $\mathbb{S}10{,}000$ might not buy a stock selling for $\mathbb{S}150$ , for instance, because she cannot afford to buy 100 shares. However, she might buy the stock if the price were less than $\mathbb{S}100$ as the result of a stock dividend. In such cases, the stock price decrease at the time of a stock dividend will likely not be exactly proportional to the number of new shares issued.  

When a company’s board of directors declares a stock dividend, the company transfers an amount from the Retained Earnings account (or the Additional Paid-in Capital account) into the Common Stock account to reflect the additional shares issued. The amount transferred depends on whether the stock dividend is classified as a large stock dividend or a small stock dividend.  

A large stock dividend involves the distribution of additional shares that amount to more than 20–25 percent of currently outstanding shares. A small stock dividend involves the distribution of shares that amount to less than 20–25 percent of currently outstanding shares. Because a large stock dividend significantly decreases a company’s stock price, GAAP requires the amount transferred to the Common Stock account to be based on the par value of the stock. In the case of a small stock dividend, GAAP requires the amount transferred to be based on the market price of the stock, with the par value amount being transferred to the Common Stock account and the excess transferred to the Additional Paid-in Capital account.  

To demonstrate how the accounting for stock dividends works, assume Microsoft declared a large stock dividend that resulted in an additional 40,000,000 shares of $\mathbb{S}0.00000625$ par value stock being distributed to stockholders. On the date of declaration, Microsoft would record the following journal entry:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Retained earnings (-SE) ($0.00000625 × 40,000,000)</td><td>250</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Common stock(+SE)($0.00000625× 40,000,000)</td><td></td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities</td><td>十 Stockholders'Equity Retainedearnings Commonstock</td><td>-$250 +$250</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Now assume Microsoft declared a small stock dividend that resulted in an additional 4,000,000 shares being distributed to stockholders. On the date of declaration, Microsoft’s stock was trading at $\mathbb{S}220$ per share. The journal entry Microsoft would enter is:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Retained earnings (-SE)($220 market price × 4,000,000)</td><td>880,000,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Common stock (+SE) ($0.00000625 par value × 4,000,000)</td><td></td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Additionalpaid-incapital(+SE)(remainder)</td><td>Additionalpaid-incapital</td><td>879,999,975 -880,000,000 25 +879,999,975</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities +</td><td colspan="2">Stockholders'Equity Retainedearnings Commonstock</td></tr></table></body></html>  

It is important to note that regardless of whether a stock dividend is classified as large or small, there is no change in the total amount of stockholders’ equity. Both large and small stock dividends merely redistribute amounts within the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet.  

## Stock Splits  

Stock splits are not dividends. While they are similar to a stock dividend in the sense that they distribute additional shares of stock to stockholders, they are quite different in terms of how they impact accounts in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet.  

Whether a company distributes additional shares of stock by declaring a stock dividend or by initiating a stock split often is determined by state law. In a stock split, a company commits to giving stockholders a specified number of additional shares for each share that they currently hold. For example, when a company declares a two-for-one stock split, a stockholder who owned one share of stock before the split will own two shares of stock after the split. In essence, the one share has been “split” into two shares. A company’s footnotes will state whether the stock split applies to all authorized, issued, and outstanding shares.  

![](images/e33bb9c74505b22b979079b9d1404ff9f4750732cfb0f407747a6e292e266790.jpg)  
Left: Image Source, all rights reserved; Right: VDB Photos/Shutterstock  

When a company initiates a stock split, it also reduces the par value of its stock so that the total dollar amount in the Common Stock account remains unchanged. For instance, if Microsoft executes a two-for-one stock split, thereby doubling the number of shares issued, it would reduce the par value of its stock from $\hphantom{-}80.000000025\hphantom{-}$ to \$0.000003125. Microsoft has executed many stock splits since it went public in 1981, which is one of the reasons its par value is so small. In contrast to a stock dividend, a stock split does not change any account balances in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet.  

In both a stock dividend and a stock split, the stockholder receives more shares of stock without having to invest additional resources to acquire the shares. A stock dividend requires a journal entry; a stock split does not but is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The comparative effects of a large stock dividend versus a stock split may be summarized as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">STOCKHOLDERS'EQUITY</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Before</td><td>Aftera1o0%Stock Dividend</td><td>Aftera2-for-1 Stock Split</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Number of shares outstanding Par value per share</td><td>300,000</td><td>600,000</td><td>600,000</td></tr><tr><td>$ 1.00</td><td>$ 1.00</td><td>$ 0.50</td></tr><tr><td>300,000</td><td>600,000</td><td>300,000</td></tr><tr><td>Commonstock Retained earnings</td><td>650,000</td><td>350,000</td><td>650,000</td></tr><tr><td>Totalstockholders'equity</td><td>$950,000</td><td>$950,000</td><td>$950,000</td></tr></table></body></html>  

It is quite common for companies to announce a “stock split” but to account for the distribution of additional shares as a large stock dividend. Companies typically do this to avoid changing the par value of their common stock. Such announcements are referred to as initiating a “stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend.” Whenever you see this phrase, know that the company has accounted for the transaction as a large stock dividend.

## STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  

The purpose of the statement of stockholders’ equity is to show how accounts in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet have changed over the accounting period. Common accounts shown are common stock, additional paid-in capital, treasury stock or repurchased stock, and retained earnings. The statement of stockholders’ equity for Microsoft is shown in Exhibit 11.3.  

As you review Exhibit 11.3, you will observe many of the issues discussed in this chapter. Notice for example that in fiscal 2020 Microsoft:  

1.	Issued common stock totaling $\mathbb{S}1{,}343$ million.   
2.	Repurchased common stock totaling $^{\mathbb{S}4,599}$ million.   
3.	Granted stock-based compensation totaling $^\mathrm{55,289}$ million.   
4.	Reported net income of $\mathbb{S}44{,}281$ million, which increased retained earnings.   
5.	Issued a common stock cash dividend totaling $^{\mathbb{S}15,483}$ million, which decreased   
retained earnings.  

At the bottom of the statement is a section entitled “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” This section captures several important items that are reported as a part of comprehensive income, but not net income. Examples of items that are not included in the computation of net income include:  

1.	Unrealized holding gains or losses from certain types of debt securities. Under GAAP, gains and losses from holding certain types of debt securities are reported on the income statement only when the securities are sold. Unrealized gains and losses that occur before the securities are sold are included in comprehensive income.

2.	Foreign currency translation gains and losses. Many U.S. companies have foreign subsidiaries that conduct business using foreign currencies. Incorporating the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries into a U.S. company’s financial statements requires the use of a foreign currency exchange rate. Changes in exchange rates from year to year result in foreign currency translation gains and losses. These gains and losses are included in comprehensive income.

## PREFERRED STOCK TRANSACTIONS  

In addition to common stock, some corporations issue preferred stock. The journal entries required to record the issuance and repurchase of preferred stock are the same as the journal entries required to record the issuance and repurchase of common stock. Preferred stock, however, differs from common stock in a number of ways. The most significant differences are:  

•	 Preferred stock typically does not have voting rights. Without voting rights, preferred stock does not appeal to investors who want some control over the operations of a corporation. The lack of voting rights is one of the reasons some corporations issue preferred stock to raise capital: Issuing preferred stock permits them to raise money without issuing additional common shares with voting rights.  

•	 Preferred stock is less risky. Generally, preferred stock is less risky than common stock because holders receive priority payment of dividends and distribution of assets if the corporation goes out of business. Usually a specified amount per share must be paid to preferred stockholders before any remaining assets can be distributed to the common stockholders.  

•	 Preferred stock typically has a fixed dividend rate. For example, “6 percent preferred stock, par value $\mathbb{S}10$ per share,” pays an annual dividend of 6 percent of par value, or $\mathbb{S}0.60$ per share. If preferred stock had no par value, the preferred dividend would be specified as $\updelta0.60$ per share. The fixed dividend is attractive to certain investors who want stable income from their investments.  

Describe the characteristics of preferred stock and report preferred stock transactions.  

## Dividends on Preferred Stock  

Preferred stock offers several dividend preferences over common stock. The two most common preferences are a current dividend preference and a cumulative dividend preference.  

## Current Dividend Preference  

The current dividend preference requires a company to pay dividends to preferred stockholders before paying dividends to common stockholders. This preference is always a feature of preferred stock. After the current dividend preference has been met and if no other preference is operative, dividends can be paid to the common stockholders. To illustrate, assume Wally Company has the following stock outstanding:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>WALLYCOMPANY</td></tr><tr><td>Preferred stock: 6%, $20 parvalue,2,000s shares outstanding = $40,000 Commons stock:$10 parvalue,5,000s shares outstanding = $50,000</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Assuming a current dividend preference only, dividends would be allocated as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Example</td><td>TotalDividends</td><td>6%PreferredStock</td><td>CommonStock</td></tr><tr><td>No. 1</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$2,400</td><td>$ 600</td></tr><tr><td>No.2</td><td>18,000</td><td>2,400</td><td>15,600</td></tr></table></body></html>

\*Preferred dividend calculation: $\mathbb{S}20$ par value $\times\:0.06\times2{,}000$ shares $=\mathbb{S}2{,}400$ .  

## Cumulative Dividend Preference  

The cumulative dividend preference requires any unpaid dividends on preferred stock to accumulate. This cumulative unpaid amount, known as dividends in arrears, must be paid before any common dividends can be paid. Of course, if the preferred stock is noncumulative, dividends can never be in arrears, and therefore any dividend that is not declared is permanently lost. Preferred stock is usually cumulative.  

To illustrate the cumulative dividend preference, assume that Wally Company’s preferred stock in the above example is cumulative and that dividends have been in arrears for two years.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 11-9  

Discuss the impact of stock transactions on cash flows.  

The existence of dividends in arrears on preferred stock can limit a company’s ability to pay dividends to common stockholders and can affect a company’s future cash flows. Because dividends are never an actual liability until the board of directors declares them, dividends in arrears are not reported on the balance sheet. Instead, they are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.  

## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  

## Preferred Stock and Limited Voting Rights  

Though not typical, some preferred stock has special voting rights. For example, the excerpt below is from Public Storage’s 2020 Annual Report:  

The holders of our Preferred Shares have general preference rights with respect to liquidation, quarterly distributions and any accumulated unpaid distributions. Except as noted below, holders of the Preferred Shares do not have voting rights. In the event of a cumulative arrearage equal to six quarterly dividends, holders of all outstanding series of preferred shares . . . will have the right to elect two additional members to serve on our board of trustees (our “Board”) until the arrearage has been cured. At December 31, 2020, there were no dividends in arrears.  

Source: Public Storage  

This special voting right allows preferred stockholders to have some say in operational matters if the company has had difficulty paying dividends for an extended period of time.

## Chapter Supplement  

Accounting for the Equity of Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships  

Owner’s Equity for a Sole Proprietorship  

A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business owned by one person. Only two owner’s equity accounts are typically used. The first is a capital account for the proprietor (e.g., Hans Solo, capital). The second is a drawing or withdrawal account for the proprietor (e.g., Hans Solo, drawing).  

The capital account of a sole proprietorship serves two purposes: to record investments by the owner and to accumulate the income or loss each accounting period. The drawing account is used to record the owner’s withdrawals of cash or other assets from the business during an accounting period. The drawing account is a temporary account that is closed to the owner’s capital account at the end of each accounting period. Thus, the capital account reflects the cumulative total of all investments by the owner and all earnings of the entity less all withdrawals by the owner.  

In most respects, the accounting for a sole proprietorship is the same as for a corporation. Exhibit 11.5 presents the recording of selected transactions of Hans Solo Aviation and the Statement of owner’s Equity.  

## Selected Entries during Year 1

Because a sole proprietorship does not pay income taxes, its financial statements do not reflect income tax expense or income taxes payable. Instead, the net income of a sole proprietorship is taxed when it is included on the owner’s personal income tax return. Likewise, any withdrawal by the sole proprietor is not recognized as an expense but rather is accounted for as a distribution of capital.  

## Owners’ Equity for a Partnership  

The Uniform Partnership Act, which most states have adopted, defines a partnership as “an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business for profit.” Small businesses and professionals such as accountants, doctors, and lawyers often use the partnership form of business.  

A partnership is formed by two or more persons reaching mutual agreement about the terms of the relationship. The agreement between the partners constitutes a partnership contract and specifies matters such as division of periodic income, management responsibilities, transfer or sale of partnership interests, disposition of assets upon liquidation, and procedures to be followed in case of the death of a partner or disagreements. If the partnership agreement does not specify these matters, the laws of the resident state take precedence.  

The primary advantages of a partnership are (1) ease of formation, (2) complete control by the partners, and (3) lack of income taxes on the business itself. The primary disadvantage is the unlimited liability of each partner for the partnership’s debts. If the partnership does not have sufficient assets to satisfy outstanding debt, creditors of the partnership can seize the partners’ personal assets.  

As with a sole proprietorship, accounting for a partnership follows the same underlying principles as any other form of business organization, except for those entries that directly affect owners’ equity. Accounting for partners’ equity follows the same pattern as for a sole proprietorship, except that separate capital and drawing accounts are established for each partner. The net income of a partnership is divided among the partners in accordance with the partnership agreement.  

Exhibit 11.6 presents selected journal entries and a Statement of Owners’ Equity for Mirror Image Partners to illustrate the accounting for partnerships.  

## Selected Entries during Year 1

Like a sole proprietorship, a partnership does not report income tax expense on its income statement. Partners must report their share of the partnership profits on their individual tax returns. Also like sole proprietorships, withdrawals by the partners are not recorded as expenses but rather are treated as distributions of capital.

11-1.	Explain the role of stock in the capital structure of a corporation. p. 577  

Issuing stock is one way corporations raise capital. Corporations issue stock by selling shares to investors, who then become owners of the corporation. Investors can trade their stock on established stock exchanges.  

11-2.	Compute and analyze the earnings per share ratio. p. 579  

The earnings per share (EPS) ratio is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The EPS ratio facilitates the comparison of companies based on how much they earn per share of common stock outstanding.  

11-3.	Describe the characteristics of common stock and report common stock transactions. p. 579  

Common stock is the basic voting stock issued by a corporation. Many states require common stock to have a par value. Common stock transactions consist of (1) the initial sale of shares, (2) repurchasing shares, (3) declaring and paying cash dividends, and (4) initiating stock dividends and stock splits.  

Investors earn a return on their stock investment through stock price appreciation, the receipt of cash dividends, or both. Cash dividends are payments to stockholders, typically on a per share basis. A company records a dividend as a liability when its board of directors declares the dividend (i.e., on the date of declaration). The liability is satisfied when the company pays the cash dividend to stockholders (i.e., on the date of payment).  

11-5.	Compute and analyze the dividend yield ratio. p. 584  

The dividend yield ratio is computed by dividing dividends per share by a stock’s market price per share. The dividend yield ratio measures an investor’s return on investment attributed to the dividends a company pays.  

11-6.	Discuss and report stock dividends and stock splits. p. 588  

Stock dividends and stock splits are both ways for companies to distribute additional shares of stock to existing stockholders. When a company initiates a stock dividend, it records a journal entry that transfers the dividend amount from the retained earnings account to the common stock account and, if applicable, the additional paid-in capital account. When a company initiates a stock split, no journal entry is required; rather, the company simply increases the number of shares issued and decreases the par value per share.  

11-7.	Describe the information reported on the statement of stockholders’ equity. p. 591  

The statement of stockholders’ equity is one of the four financial statements required by GAAP. It shows how accounts that affect the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet have changed over the accounting period. Examples of accounts reported are common stock, preferred stock, repurchased shares or treasury stock, retained earnings, and components of comprehensive income.  

11-8.	Describe the characteristics of preferred stock and report preferred stock transactions. p. 593  

The purpose of preferred stock is the same as that of common stock: to raise capital. Preferred stock differs from common stock in that it is issued on a more selective basis, typically does not have voting rights, has a current dividend preference, and may have a cumulative dividend preference. A current dividend preference specifies that preferred stockholders will receive dividends before common stockholders. A cumulative dividend preference specifies that preferred stockholders will receive any past unpaid dividends before common stockholders receive current dividends.  

11-9.	Discuss the impact of stock transactions on cash flows. p. 594  

Any cash inflows or outflows associated with a company’s stock are reported in the Financing Activities section of the company’s statement of cash flows. Typical inflows are the issuance of stock and the reselling of treasury shares. Typical outflows are the repurchase of common stock and the pay ment of dividends.  

This chapter concludes a major section of the book. In the previous five chapters, we have discussed individual sections of the balance sheet. We will now shift our focus to the statement of cash flows. In the next chapter, you will learn how companies report cash transactions on the statement of cash flows and how companies use information from the balance sheet and income statement to create the statement of cash flows.  

The earnings per share ratio reflects how much a company earned per share of common stock outstanding. The ratio is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Ownership of a Corporation section):  

![](images/53945862a39264fc1a813c88e36b84d249c620da002b52ac6a0282a02996983f.jpg)  

The dividend yield ratio measures the return on investment attributable to the dividends a company pays. The ratio is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Dividends on Common Stock section):

Dividends, once declared by the board of directors, are reported as a current liability until paid.   
Under Stockholders’ Equity   
Typical accounts include: Common stock Preferred stock Repurchased shares or treasury stock Additional paid-in capital Retained earnings  

## Income Statement  

Capital stock transactions do not affect the income statement. Dividends paid are not an expense. They are a distribution of income and are, therefore, taken directly out of stockholders’ equity by reducing retained earnings.  

## Statement of Cash Flows  

Under Financing Activities $^+$ Cash inflows from initial sale of stock $^+$ Cash inflows from sale of treasury stock − Cash outflows for repurchasing stock − Cash outflows for dividends  

## Statement of Stockholders’ Equity  

This statement reports detailed information concerning stockholders’ equity, including Beginning and ending balances in each equity account, Impact of transactions such as issuing stock, repurchasing stock, earning income and paying dividends, Information concerning any gains or losses that affect comprehensive income.  

## Notes  

Under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Capital stock is typically not discussed in detail in the summary footnote.   
Under a Separate Note Most companies report information about their employee stock option plans and information about stock transactions that occurred during the period. Information about dividends declared and paid and any dividends in arrears on preferred stock are also reported in the notes.

## Analyzing Dividend Policy (AP11-9)  

Heather and Scott, two young financial analysts, were reviewing financial statements for Google, one of the world’s largest technology companies. Scott noted that the company did not report any dividends in the financing activity section of the statement of cash flows and said, “I have heard that Google is a very profitable company. If it’s so profitable, why isn’t it paying any dividends?” Heather wasn’t convinced that Scott was looking in the right place for dividends but didn’t say anything.  

Scott continued the discussion by noting, “Sales for Google are up nearly 46 percent over the previous two years, while net income is up over $\mathbb{S}3$ billion compared to last year, and cash flows from operating activities are up over $\mathbb{S}6$ billion to a total of $\mathbb{S}54$ billion.”

## Analyzing Dividend Policy (P11-9)  

Alonzo and Mika, two students in a financial statement analysis class, were reviewing financial statements for Facebook, one of the world’s largest social-media companies. Alonzo noted that the company did not report any dividends in the financing activity section of the statement of cash flows and said, “I have heard that Facebook is a very profitable company. If it’s so profitable, why isn’t it paying any dividends?” Mika wasn’t convinced that Alonzo was looking in the right place for dividends but didn’t say anything.  

Alonzo continued his analysis and noted, “Revenues for Facebook are up nearly $\mathbb{S}15$ billion over the previous year, while net income is up almost $\mathbb{S}2$ billion compared to last year, and the company reported over $\mathbb{S}38$ billion in operating cash flows.”  

At that point, Mika noted that the statement of cash flows reported that Facebook had spent almost $^{\S34}$ billion to purchase marketable securities and $\mathbb{S}6$ billion to repurchase stock. She was confused about whether Facebook was in a good position to pay dividends or not.  

Required:  

1.	 Is Mika’s concern that Alonzo is looking at the wrong section of the statement of cash flows justified?   
2.	 Is there a right time for a company like Facebook to start paying a dividend?

## Critical Thinking Cases  

## Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma  

You are a member of the board of directors of a large company that has been in business for more than 100 years. The company is proud of the fact that it has paid dividends every year it has been in business. Because of this stability, many retired people have invested large portions of their savings in your common stock. Unfortunately, the company has struggled for the past few years as it tries to introduce new products and is considering not paying a dividend this year. The president wants to skip the dividend in order to have more cash to invest in product development: “If we don’t invest this money now, we won’t get these products to market in time to save the company. I don’t want to risk thousands of jobs.” One of the most senior board members speaks next: “If we don’t pay the dividend, thousands of retirees will be thrown into financial distress. Even if you don’t care about them, you have to recognize our stock price will crash when they all sell.” The company treasurer proposes an alternative: “Let’s skip the cash dividend and pay a stock dividend. We can still say we’ve had a dividend every year.” The entire board now turns to you for your opinion. What should the company do?

## Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma  

You are the president of a very successful biotech company that has had a remarkably profitable year. You have determined that the company has more than $\mathbb{S}10$ million in excess cash that was generated by operating activities during the year. You are thinking about paying it out to stockholders as a special dividend. You discuss the idea with your vice president, who reacts angrily to your suggestion:  

Our stock price has gone up by 200 percent in the last year alone. What more do we have to do for the owners? The people who really earned that money are the employees who have been working 12 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week, to make the company successful. Most of them didn’t even take vacations last year. I say we have to pay out bonuses and nothing extra for the stockholders.  

As president, you know that you are hired by the board of directors, which is elected by the stockholders. What is your responsibility to both groups? How would you recommend allocating the $\mathbb{s}10$ million?
