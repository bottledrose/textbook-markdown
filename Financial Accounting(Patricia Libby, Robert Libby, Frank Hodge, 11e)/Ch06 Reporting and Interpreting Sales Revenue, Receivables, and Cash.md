# Ch06 Reporting and Interpreting Sales Revenue, Receivables, and Cash

Since its founding in 1992, Skechers U.S.A., Inc., has become a major player in the active, casual, dress casual, and athletic footwear market reporting over $5.2 billion in sales for 2019. Its growth strategy requires building brand recognition by developing and introducing additional innovative footwear that satisfy the company’s high standards for styling, quality, comfort, and affordability. Skechers accurately recognized changing tastes in footwear both for work and play and focuses on a price point in the largest segment of the footwear market. It also supports increased brand recognition with focused advertising relying on celebrity endorsements. But unlike athletic apparel titans such as Nike and Under Armour who contract mainly with the biggest current names in sports, Skechers celebrity endorsers are a mix of former and current athletes and entertainers including Clayton Kershaw, Brooke Henderson, Howie Long, David Ortiz, Tony Romo, Matt Kuchar, and Sugar Ray Leonard. These endorsers appeal to the broad range of customers for Skechers more than 3,000 footwear styles covering every age and activity.  

Skechers currently markets more than 3,000 footwear styles for men, women, and children. To sell its footwear, it has developed a very successful multichannel distribution system. First, it sells to department and specialty stores such as Kohl’s and Dick’s Sporting Goods where it acts as a wholesaler. It also sells directly to consumers through more than 800 Skechers retail stores and online at skechers.com. Its wholesale and retail channels present different accounting issues that we will focus on in this chapter. Outside of the United States, it continues to penetrate new markets through its international subsidiaries and joint ventures in Asia, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. These international ventures have been the largest source of recent sales growth.

## UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS  

Planning Skechers’ growth strategy requires careful coordination of sales activities, as well as cash collections from customers. Much of this coordination revolves around allowing consumers to use credit cards, providing business customers discounts for early payment, and allowing sales returns and allowances under certain circumstances—strategies that motivate customers to buy its products and make payment for their purchases. These activities affect net sales revenue, the top line on the income statement. Coordinating sales and cash collections from customers also involves managing bad debts, which affect selling, general, and administrative expenses on the income statement and cash and accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Net sales, accounts receivable, and cash are the focus of this chapter. We also will introduce the receivables turnover ratio as a measure of the efficiency of credit-granting and collection activities. Finally, because the cash collected from customers is also a tempting target for fraud and embezzlement, we will discuss how accounting systems commonly include controls to prevent and detect such misdeeds.

## ACCOUNTING FOR NET SALES REVENUE  

As indicated in Chapter 3, the revenue recognition principle requires that revenues be recorded when the company transfers goods and services to customers, in the amount it expects to be entitled to receive. For sellers of goods, sales revenue is recorded when title and risks of ownership transfer to the buyer. The point at which title (ownership) changes hands is determined by the shipping terms in the sales contract. When goods are shipped FOB (free on board) shipping point, title changes hands at shipment and the buyer normally pays for shipping. When they are shipped FOB destination, title changes hands on delivery and the seller normally pays for shipping. Skechers ships its goods to retailers, such as Kohl’s and Dick’s, FOB shipping point. Revenues from goods shipped FOB shipping point are normally recognized at shipment. Revenues from goods shipped FOB destination are normally recognized at delivery.  

Service companies most often record sales revenue when they have provided services to the buyer. Companies disclose the revenue recognition rule they follow in the footnote to the financial statements entitled Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. In that note, Skechers reports the following:

The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. . . . The Company recognizes revenue on wholesale sales upon shipment as that is when the customer obtains control of the promised goods. . . . For in-store sales, the Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale. For sales made through its websites, the Company recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer which is when the customer obtains control of the promised good. . . .

The appropriate amount of revenue to record is the amount it expects to be entitled to receive. Revenue recognition for more complex sales contracts with multiple performance obligations requires application of the five-step process which is discussed at the end of this section.  

## Motivating Sales and Collections  

Some sales practices differ depending on whether sales are made to businesses or consumers. Skechers sells footwear and apparel to other businesses, which then sell the goods to consumers. It also operates its own online and physical retail stores that sell footwear directly to consumers.  

Skechers and other companies use a variety of methods to motivate both groups of customers to buy its products and make payment for their purchases. The principal methods include (1) allowing consumers to use credit cards to pay for purchases, (2) providing business customers direct credit and discounts for early payment, and (3) allowing returns from all customers under certain circumstances. These methods, in turn, affect the way we compute net sales revenue.  

## Credit Card Sales to Consumers  

Skechers accepts cash or credit card payment for its retail store and online sales. Retailers accept credit cards (mainly Visa, Mastercard, and American Express) for a variety of reasons:  

1.	Increasing customer traffic.   
2.	Avoiding the costs of providing credit directly to consumers, including recordkeeping and bad debts (discussed later).   
3.	Lowering losses due to bad checks.   
4.	Avoiding losses from fraudulent credit card sales. (As long as the retailer follows the credit card company’s verification procedure, the credit card company [e.g., Visa] absorbs any losses.)   
5.	Receiving money faster. (Because credit card receipts can be deposited directly in its bank account, Skechers receives its money faster than it would if it provided credit directly to consumers.)  

The credit card company charges a fee for the service it provides. For example, when Skechers deposits its credit card receipts in the bank, it might receive credit for only 97 percent of the sales price. The credit card company is charging a 3 percent fee (the credit card discount) for its services. If daily credit card sales were $\mathbb{S}3{,}000$ , Skechers would report the following:  

Sales revenue $\mathbb{S}\;3{,}000$ Less: Credit card discounts $(0.03\times\mathbb{8}3,000)$ 90 Net sales (reported on the income statement) \$2,910  

The accounting by the retailer is the same when a consumer uses a contactless mobile payment app such as Google Pay or Apple Pay to charge a purchase to one of their credit cards.  

## Sales Discounts to Businesses  

Most of Skechers’ sales to businesses are credit sales on open account; that is, there is no formal written promissory note or credit card. When Skechers sells footwear to retailers on credit, credit terms are printed on the sales document and invoice (bill) sent to the customer. Often credit terms are abbreviated. For example, if the full price is due within 30 days of the invoice date, the credit terms would be noted as ${\bf{n}}/30.$ . Here, the n means the sales amount net of, or less, any sales returns.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 6-1  

Analyze the impact of credit card sales, sales discounts, sales returns, and sales of bundled items on the amounts reported as net sales.  

![](images/d4a30d409a864a06aab2c80dde366541ee39b6ec7c0c61a8ad24075313712dc1.jpg)  
Early Payment Incentive  

In some cases, a sales discount (often called a cash discount) is granted to the purchaser to encourage early payment.1 For example, Skechers could offer terms of $2/10,\,\mathrm{n}/30$ , which means that the customer may deduct 2 percent from the invoice price if cash payment is made within 10 days from the date of sale. If cash payment is not made within the 10-day discount period, the full sales price (less any returns) is due within a maximum of 30 days.  

Companies offer this sales discount to encourage customers to pay more quickly. This provides two benefits:  

1.	Prompt receipt of cash from customers reduces the necessity to borrow money to meet operating needs.   
2.	Because customers tend to pay bills providing discounts first, a sales discount also decreases the chances that the customer will run out of funds before the company’s bill is paid.  

Companies commonly record sales discounts taken by subtracting the discount from sales if payment is made within the discount period. For example, if credit sales of $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ are recorded with terms $2/10,\mathfrak{n}/30$ and payment of $\mathbb{S}980$ $\mathbb{5}1,000\times0.98=\mathbb{5}980$ ) is made within the discount period, net sales of the following amount would be reported:  

Sales revenue $\begin{array}{r}{\mathbb{8}1,\!000}\\ {\frac{20}{\mathbb{9}\mathbb{8}0}}\end{array}$ Less: Sales discounts $(0.02\times\mathbb{1},000)$ ) Net sales (reported on the income statement)  

If payment is made after the discount period, the full $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ would be reported as net sales. Accounting for sales discounts is discussed in more detail in the Supplement at the end of this chapter. Any quantity discounts or rebates provided to customers also must be subtracted in the computation of net sales.  

## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  

## To Take or Not to Take the Discount, That Is the Question  

Purchasers often pay within the discount period because the savings are substantial. With terms 2/10, $\mathfrak{n}/30$ , customers save 2 percent by paying 20 days early (on the 10th day instead of the 30th). This translates into a 37 percent annual interest rate. To calculate the annual interest rate, first compute the interest rate for the discount period. When the 2 percent discount is taken, the customer pays only 98 percent of the gross sales price. For example, on a $\mathbb{S}100$ sale with terms $2/10,\mathrm{n}/30$ , $\mathbb{S}2$ would be saved and $\mathbb{S}98$ would be paid 20 days early.  

The interest rate for the 20-day discount period and the annual interest rate are computed as follows:  

_A_m__o_u_nt_ _S_a_ve_d_ $=$ Interest Rate for 20 Days Interest Rate for 20 Days×​ _2_0_ _d_a_y_s_  ​ Annual Interest   
Amount Paid Rate $\frac{\mathfrak{P}2}{\mathfrak{P}98}=2.04\%\;\mathrm{for}\;20\;\mathrm{Days}$ $2.04\%\times{\frac{365\ {\mathrm{days}}}{20\ {\mathrm{days}}}}\,{=}{\frac{37.23\%}{\mathrm{Interest}}}$ A Rnatneu a l  

As long as the bank’s interest rate is less than the interest rate associated with failing to take cash discounts, the customer will save by taking the cash discount. For example, even if credit customers had to borrow from the bank at a rate as high as 15 percent, they would save a great deal.  

## Sales Returns and Allowances  

Retailers and consumers have a right to return unsatisfactory or damaged merchandise and receive a refund or an adjustment to their bill. Such returns are often accumulated in a separate account called Sales Returns and Allowances and must be deducted from gross sales revenue in determining net sales. This account informs Skechers’ managers of the volume of returns and allowances and thus provides an important measure of the quality of customer service. Assume that Fontana’s Shoes of Ithaca, New York, buys 40 pairs of athletic shoes (at $\mathbb{S}50$ each) from Skechers for $^{\S2,000}$ on account. Before paying for the shoes, Fontana’s discovers that 10 pairs of shoes are not the color ordered and returns them to Skechers.3 Skechers would compute net sales as follows:  

$$
{\begin{array}{l l l}{{\mathrm{Sales~revenue}}}&{}&{{\S2,000}}\\ {{\mathrm{Less:~Sales~returns~and~allowances~(10~pairs\times\S50)}}}&{}&{{\frac{500}{\sqrt{1.500}}}}\\ {{\mathrm{Net~sales~(reported~on~the~income~statement)}}}&{}&{{\S1,500}}\end{array}}
$$  

Cost of goods sold related to the 10 pairs of shoes also would be reduced.  

## Reporting Net Sales  

On the company’s books, credit card discounts, sales discounts, and sales returns and allowances are accounted for separately to allow managers to monitor the costs of credit card use, sales discounts, and returns. Using the numbers in the preceding examples, the amount of net sales reported on the income statement is computed in the following manner:  

Sales revenue \$6,000   
Less: Credit card discounts (a contra-revenue) 90   
Sales discounts (a contra-revenue) 20   
Sales returns and allowances (a contra-revenue) 500   
Net sales (included on the first line of the income statement) \$5,390  

Net Sales to all customers is the top line reported on Skechers’ income statement, presented in Exhibit 6.1. Skechers indicates in its revenue recognition footnote that the appropriate subtractions are made.

The amount of revenue to record is the entitled to receive. Consequently, credit card discounts, sales discounts, and sales returns and allowances must be subtracted to compute net sales.

## A QUESTION OF ETHICS  

## Volume Discounts/Rebates and Earnings Misstatements at Monsanto  

In 2016, the SEC found that agribusiness company Monsanto had materially misstated company revenues and earnings by improperly accounting for volume discounts and rebates offered to retailers and distributors of its flagship product, Roundup. In an attempt to offset the effects of generic competition for Roundup, Monsanto instituted new discount and rebate programs. As we learned in Chapter 3 and in this chapter, net sales revenue should be recorded “in the amount the company expects to be entitled to receive.” This rule requires that Monsanto reduce the amount of reported net sales by the expected rebates in the period of sale. Instead, Monsanto delayed recording these reductions until the following year, overstating net sales and earnings before taxes by $\mathbb{S}44.5$ million and $\mathbb{S}48$ million, respectively, over two years. Monsanto also improperly accounted for additional rebates of more than $\mathbb{S}56$ million as selling, general, and administrative expense instead of a reduction in net sales. This practice overstated gross profit, an important measure used by analysts to assess competitive pricing pressure, but did not affect income before taxes. Monsanto agreed to pay an $\mathbb{S}80$ million penalty to settle these violations and three Monsanto managers paid penalties of between $\mathbb{S}30{,}000$ and $^\mathrm{\Phi}_{\mathbb{}}55{,}000$ for their involvement in the scheme. And Monsanto’s CEO and CFO returned bonuses of $\mathbb{53}\mathrm{,}165\mathrm{,}852$ and $^{\S728,843}$ they had received as a result of the earnings overstatements, though they were not found to be involved in personal misconduct.  

In the last section, we learned to analyze the impact of credit card sales, sales discounts, and sales returns, all of which reduce the amounts reported as net sales. Both credit card discounts and sales or cash discounts promote faster receipt of cash. Sales returns and allowances include refunds and adjustments to customers’ bills for defective or incorrect merchandise.  

Before you move on, complete the following questions to test your understanding of these concepts.  

1.	 Assume that Skechers sold $^{\mathbb{S}30,000}$ worth of footwear to various retailers with terms $1/10$ , $\upmu/30$ and half of that amount was paid within the discount period. Gross retail store and online sales were $\Phi5{,}000$ for the same period; 80 percent of these sales were paid for with credit cards with a 3 percent discount and the rest were paid for with cash. Compute net sales for the period. 2.	 During the fourth quarter of 2019, Skechers’ net sales totaled $\mathbb{S}1,330,732$ and cost of sales was $^{\Phi692,983}$ . What was Skechers’ gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2019?

## Revenue Recognition for Bundled Goods and Services: A Five-Step Process  

Bundling of goods and services within one sales contract is common in a variety of industries. For example, Verizon sells its cell phones at a discount when purchased as part of a two-year service contract. When Jaguar sells its new cars to customers, it bundles a fairly complete fiveyear warranty and five years of scheduled maintenance “free” with the purchase. And when Apple sells its iPad, the contract with its customer includes not only the iPad and software essential to the functioning of the product, but future upgrades relating to the essential software. When a seller promises to provide more than one good or service in a single sales contract, FASB standards specify a five-step process to determine the amount to be recognized as revenue. Let’s assume that the total selling price for an iPad is $\mathbb{S}500$ , (1) $\mathbb{S}450$ of which relates to the hardware with essential software and (2) $\mathbb{S}50$ of which relates to future software upgrades that would be provided over five years. In this case, we would apply the five-step process as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Step1:Identifythecontractbetweenthecompanyandcustomer.</td><td>Bundled:iPad“withessentialsoftware”andrelatedfutureupgradeservices</td></tr><tr><td>Step 2: ：Identifytheperformanceobligations(promisedgoodsand services).</td><td>#1Hardwarewithessentialsoftware #2Futuresoftwareupgrades</td></tr><tr><td>Step 3: Determine the transaction price.</td><td>$500 total</td></tr><tr><td>Step4:Allocate thetransactionpriceto theperformance obligations.</td><td>#1H Hardwarewithessentialsoftware→S450 #2 Future software upgrades→$50</td></tr><tr><td>Step5:R Recognizerevenuewheneachperformanceobligationissatis- fied(orovertimeifaserviceisprovidedovertime).</td><td>#1H Hardware with essential software → $450 in year 1 #2 Future software upgrades → $50/5 = $10 each year for five years</td></tr></table></body></html>  

As a result, revenue from the contract would be recognized as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue</td><td>$450 + $10 = $460</td><td>$10</td><td>$10</td><td>$10</td><td>$10</td><td>$500</td></tr></table></body></html>  

## MEASURING AND REPORTING RECEIVABLES  

## Classifying Receivables  

Receivables may be classified in three common ways. First, they may be classified as either an account receivable or a note receivable. An accounts receivable is created by a credit sale on an open account. For example, an account receivable is created when Skechers sells shoes on  

S o l u t i o n s  t o S E L F - S T U DY  Q U I Z  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">GrossSales</td><td>$35,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Less: Sales Discounts (0.01 × 1/2 × $30,000)</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Credit Card Discounts (0.03× 0.80× $5,000)</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">NetSales</td><td>$ 34,730</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2.

open account to Dick’s. A notes receivable is a promise in writing (a formal document) to pay (1) a specified amount of money, called the principal, at a definite future date known as the maturity date and (2) a specified amount of interest at one or more future dates. The interest is the amount charged for use of the principal.  

Second, receivables may be classified as trade or nontrade receivables. A trade receivable is created in the normal course of business when a sale of merchandise or services on credit occurs. A nontrade receivable arises from transactions other than the normal sale of merchandise or services. For example, if Skechers loaned money to a new vice president to help finance a home at the new job location, the loan would be classified as a nontrade receivable. Third, in a classified balance sheet, receivables also are classified as either current or noncurrent (short term or long term), depending on when the cash is expected to be collected. Skechers reports Trade Accounts Receivable from customers and classifies the asset as a current asset because the accounts receivable are all due to be paid within one year. It also reports Other Receivables in a much smaller amount, and also classifies that asset as a current asset.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 6-2  

Estimate, report, and evaluate the effects of uncollectible accounts receivable (bad debts) on financial statements.  

## INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE  

![](images/6479a57bbdb9dcdb1b723575ebb3e2820f75a95e25fff68e83221047c0a36430.jpg)  

Export (international) sales are a growing part of the U.S. economy. For example, international sales amounted to 57.9 percent of Skechers net sales in 2019. Most export sales to businesses are on credit. When a buyer agrees to pay in its local currency, Skechers cannot add the resulting accounts receivable, which are denominated in foreign currency, directly to its U.S. dollar accounts receivable. Skechers’ accountants first must convert them to U.S. dollars using the end-of-period exchange rate between the two currencies. For example, if a French department store owed Skechers $\epsilon20{,}000$ (euros, the common currency of the European Monetary Union) on December 31, 2019, and each euro was worth ${\mathrm{US}}\mathbb{1}.21$ on that date, Skechers would add $\mathrm{US}\Phi24{,}200$ to its accounts receivable on the balance sheet.  

## Accounting for Bad Debts  

For billing and collection purposes, Skechers keeps a separate accounts receivable account for each business customer (retailer) that resells its footwear (called a subsidiary account). The accounts receivable amount on the balance sheet represents the total of these individual customer accounts.  

When Skechers extends credit to its commercial customers, it knows that some of these customers will not pay their debts. The expense recognition principle requires recording of bad debt expense in the same accounting period in which the related sales are made. This presents an important accounting problem. Skechers may not learn which particular customers will not pay until the next accounting period. So, at the end of the period of sale, it normally does not know which customers’ accounts receivable are bad debts.  

Skechers resolves this problem by using the allowance method to measure bad debt expense. The allowance method is based on estimates of the expected amount of bad debts. Two primary steps in employing the allowance method are:  

1.	Making the end-of-period adjusting entry to record estimated bad debt expense.   
2.	Writing off specific accounts determined to be uncollectible during the period.  

## Recording Bad Debt Expense Estimates  

Bad debt expense (doubtful accounts expense, uncollectible accounts expense, provision for uncollectible accounts) is the expense associated with estimated uncollectible accounts receivable. An adjusting journal entry at the end of the accounting period records the bad debt estimate. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Skechers estimated bad debt expense to be ${\mathfrak{S}}6{,}402$ (all numbers in thousands of dollars)4 and made the following adjusting entry:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Baddebtexpense (+E,-SE)</td><td>6,402</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Allowancefor doubtful accounts S (+XA,-A)</td><td></td><td>6,402</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities</td><td>+</td><td>Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>

Allowance for doubtful accounts −6,402 Bad debt expense $\left(+\mathrm{E}\right)$ −6,402  

Tip An adjusting journal entry at the end of the accounting period records the bad debt estimate.  

The Bad Debt Expense is included in the category “General and Administrative” expenses on the income statement. It decreases net income and stockholders’ equity. Accounts Receivable could not be credited in the journal entry because there is no way to know which customers’ accounts receivable are involved. So the credit is made, instead, to a contra-asset account called Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (Allowance for Bad Debts or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts). As a contra-asset, the balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is always subtracted from the balance of the asset Accounts Receivable. Thus, the entry decreases the net book value of Accounts Receivable and total assets.  

## Writing Off Specific Uncollectible Accounts  

Throughout the year, when it is determined that a customer will not pay its debts (e.g., due to bankruptcy), the write-off of that individual bad debt is recorded through a journal entry. Now that the specific uncollectible customer account receivable has been identified, it can be removed with a credit. At the same time, we no longer need the related estimate in the contraasset Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, which is removed by a debit. The journal entry summarizing Skechers’ total write-offs of $\mathbb{S}7{,}912$ during 2019 follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Allowancefor doubtful accounts S(-XA,+A)</td><td>7,912</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Accounts receivable (-A)</td><td></td><td>7,912</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities</td><td colspan="2">+ Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>

Allowance for doubtful accounts $+7\small{,}912$ Accounts receivable −7,912  

debts are written off throughout the period   
when it is determined that a   
customer won’t pay its debts.  

Notice that this journal entry did not affect any income statement accounts. It did not record a bad debt expense because the estimated expense was recorded with an adjusting entry in the period of sale. Also, the entry did not change the net book value of accounts receivable because the decrease in the asset account (Accounts Receivable) was offset by the decrease in the contraasset account (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts). Thus, it also did not affect total assets.  

## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  

## Bad Debt Recoveries  

When a company receives a payment on an account that already has been written off, the journal entry to write off the account is reversed to put the receivable back on the books and then the collection of cash is recorded. For example, if the previously written-off amount was $\mathbb{S}677$ , it would make the following entries:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Accountsreceivable(+A)</td><td>677</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Allowance for doubtful accounts (+XA,-A)</td><td></td><td>677</td></tr><tr><td>Cash (+A)</td><td>677</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Accountsreceivable(-A)</td><td></td><td>677</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Note that these entries, like the original write-off, do not affect total assets or net income. Only the estimate of bad debts affects these amounts.  

## Summary of the Accounting Process  

It is important to remember that accounting for bad debts is a two-step process:

Skechers’ complete 2019 accounting process for bad debts can now be summarized in terms of the changes in Accounts Receivable (Gross) and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

Accounts Receivable (Gross) includes the total accounts receivable, both collectible and uncollectible. The balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is the portion of the accounts receivable balance the company estimates to be uncollectible. Accounts Receivable (Net) reported on the balance sheet is the portion of the accounts the company expects to collect (or its estimated net realizable value).  

## Reporting Accounts Receivable and Bad Debts  

Analysts who want information on Skechers’ receivables will find Accounts Receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts (the net book value), of $^{\S645,303}$ and $^{\S501,913}$ for year-end 2019 and 2018, respectively, reported on the balance sheet (Exhibit 6.2). Skechers reports the balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts $^{\leftmoon24,106}$ in 2019 and $\mathbb{S}25{,}616$ in 2018) within the account title. Other companies report the balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in a note. Accounts Receivable (Gross), the total accounts receivable, can be computed by adding the two amounts together.

When receivables are material, companies must employ the allowance method to account for uncollectibles. These are the steps in the process:  

a.	 The end-of-period adjusting entry to record the estimate of bad debt expense and increase the allowance for doubtful accounts.   
b.	 Writing off specific accounts determined to be uncollectible during the period to eliminate the specific uncollectible account receivable and decrease the allowance for doubtful accounts.  

The adjusting entry reduces net income as well as net accounts receivable. The write-off affects neither. Before you move on, complete the following questions to test your understanding of these concepts.

## Estimating Bad Debts  

The bad debt expense amount recorded in the end-of-period adjusting entry often is estimated based on either (1) a percentage of total credit sales for the period or (2) an aging of accounts receivable. Both methods are acceptable under GAAP and are widely used. The percentage of credit sales method is simpler to apply, but the aging method is generally more accurate. Many companies use the simpler method on a weekly or monthly basis and use the more accurate method on a monthly or quarterly basis to check the accuracy of the earlier estimates. In our example, both methods produce exactly the same estimate, which rarely occurs in practice.  

## Percentage of Credit Sales Method  

The percentage of credit sales method bases bad debt expense on the historical percentage of credit sales that result in bad debts. The average percentage of credit sales that result in bad debts can be computed by dividing total bad debt losses by total credit sales. A company that has been operating for some years has sufficient experience to project probable future bad debt losses. For example, if we assume that, during the year 2020, Skechers expected bad debt losses of 1.0 percent of credit sales, and its credit sales were $\Phi1{,}970{,}000$ (all numbers in thousands), it would estimate the current year’s bad debts as  

![](images/e249f12a123e8575b2da95ddb424d6f4be60938123b2dc253ec62ec3c56cf3d4.jpg)  

## The percentage of credit sales method  

is a simple one-step process where the current period’s bad debt expense is directly estimated.  

Credit sales \$1,970,000   
$\times$ Bad debt loss rate $(1.0\%)$ ) × .01   
Bad debt expense \$ 19,700  

This amount would be directly recorded as Bad Debt Expense (and an increase in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) in the current year. Our beginning balance in the Allowance for

2. Allowance for doubtful accounts (−XA, $+\mathbf{A}_{,}$ ) 4,249 Accounts receivable (−A) 4,249   
3. Beginning Balance $^+$ Bad Debt Expense Estimate − Write-Offs $=$ Ending Balance: $\mathbb{5}10,959+1,566-4,249=\mathbb{5}8,276$  

Doubtful Accounts for 2020 would be the ending balance for 2019. Assuming write-offs during 2020 of $^{\mathbb{S}14,106}$ , the ending balance is computed as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">AllowanceforDoubtful Accounts (XA)</td><td rowspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">2020Write-offs 14,106</td><td rowspan="2">2020Beginning gbalance</td><td rowspan="2">24,106</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4"></td><td>2020Baddebtexpense</td><td></td><td>Percentofcredit</td></tr><tr><td>adjustment</td><td>19,700</td><td>salesestimate</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

2020 Ending balance $\mathcal{Y}=29,700$  

## Aging of Accounts Receivable  

The aging of accounts receivable method relies on the fact that, as accounts receivable become older and more overdue, it is less likely that they will be collected. For example, a receivable that was due in 30 days but has not been paid after 120 days is less likely to be collected, on average, than a similar receivable that remains unpaid after 45 days.  

If Skechers split its assumed 2020 ending balance in accounts receivable (gross) of $^{\S670,000}$ into three age categories, it would first examine the individual customer accounts receivable and sort them into the three age categories. Based on prior experience, management would then estimate the probable bad debt loss rates for each category: for example, not yet due, 1 percent; 1 to 90 days past due, 6 percent; over 90 days, 30 percent.  

As illustrated in the aging schedule below, this would result in an estimate of total uncollectible amounts of $\mathbb{5}29{,}700$ , the estimated ending balance that should be in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. From this, the adjustment to record Bad Debt Expense (and an increase in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts) for 2020 would be computed as follows:

## Comparison of the Two Methods  

It is important to recognize that the approach to recording bad debt expense using the percentage of credit sales method is different from that for the aging method:  

•	 Percentage of credit sales. Directly compute the amount to be recorded as Bad Debt Expense on the income statement for the period in the adjusting journal entry. •	 Aging of Accounts Receivable. Compute the estimated ending balance we would like to have in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts on the balance sheet after we make the necessary adjusting entry. The difference between the current balance in the account and the estimated balance is recorded as the adjusting entry for Bad Debt Expense for the period.  

## The aging of accounts receivable method is a  

three-step process where (1) the estimated ending balance in the allowance is calculated, (2) which is compared to the current balance, (3) to compute the bad debt expense adjustment for the period.

## Actual Write-Offs Compared with Estimates  

Skechers’ Form 10-K provides clear information on its approach to estimating uncollectible accounts:  

## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Allowance for Bad Debts . . .  

The Company provides a reserve, charged against revenue and its receivables, for estimated losses that may result from its customers’ inability to pay. To minimize the likelihood of uncollectability, customers’ credit-worthiness is reviewed and adjusted periodically in accordance with external credit reporting services, financial statements issued by the customer and the Company’s experience with the account. When a customer’s account becomes significantly past due, the Company generally places a hold on the account and discontinues further shipments to that customer, minimizing further risk of loss. The Company determines the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged receivables, economic conditions in the customers’ countries or industries, historical losses and its customers’ credit-worthiness. Amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged against this reserve.  

Source: Skechers U.S.A., Inc.  

If uncollectible accounts actually written off differ from the estimated amount previously recorded, a higher or lower amount of bad debt expense is recorded in the next period to make up for the previous period’s error in estimate. For example, Skechers reported that during the second quarter of 2020, it “recorded an incremental $\mathbb{S}10.2$ million in bad debt expense, due to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on wholesale customers around the world.” When estimates are found to be incorrect, financial statement values for prior annual accounting periods are not corrected.  

## Control over Accounts Receivable  

Many managers forget that extending credit will increase sales volume, but unless the related receivables are collected, they do not add to the bottom line. Companies that emphasize sales without monitoring the collection of credit sales soon find much of their current assets tied up in accounts receivable. The following practices can help minimize bad debts:  

1.	Require approval of customers’ credit history by a person independent of the sales and collections functions.   
2.	Age accounts receivable periodically and contact customers with overdue payments.   
3.	Reward both sales and collections personnel for speedy collections so that they work as a team.  

To assess the effectiveness of overall credit-granting and collection activities, managers and analysts often compute the receivables turnover ratio.

## INTERPRETATIONS  

In General The receivables turnover ratio reflects how many times average trade receivables are recorded and collected during the period. The higher the ratio, the faster the collection of receivables. A higher ratio benefits the company because it can invest the money collected to earn interest income or reduce borrowings to reduce interest expense. Overly generous payment schedules and ineffective collection methods keep the receivables turnover ratio low. Analysts and creditors watch this ratio because a sudden decline may mean that a company is extending payment deadlines in an attempt to prop up lagging sales or is even recording sales that will later be returned by customers. Many managers and analysts compute the related number, average collection period or average days sales in receivables, which is equal to $365\div$ Receivables Turnover Ratio. It indicates the average time it takes a customer to pay its accounts. For Skechers, the amount would be computed as follows for 2019:  

$$
\mathrm{Average~Collection~Period}=\frac{365}{\mathrm{Receivables~Turnover}}=\frac{365}{9.1}=40.1~\mathrm{days}
$$  

Focus Company Analysis Skechers’ receivables turnover decreased from 11.4 in 2017 to 9.1 in 2019. This indicates that the company is taking more time to convert its receivables into cash. Compared to the receivables turnover ratios of its competitors, Skechers’ ratio is below that of Crocs and ahead of that of Wolverine World Wide, which markets Merrell, Sperry, Wolverine, and Keds.  

A Few Cautions Because differences across industries and between firms in the manner in which customer purchases are financed can cause dramatic differences in the ratio, a particular firm’s ratio should be compared only with its prior years’ figures or with other firms in the same industry following the same financing practices.  

## F OC US  ON  CAS H  F LOW S  

## Accounts Receivable  

The change in accounts receivable can be a major determinant of a company’s cash flow from operations. While the income statement reflects the revenues of the period, the cash flow from operating activities reflects cash collections from customers. Because sales on account increase the balance in accounts receivable and cash collections from customers decrease the balance in accounts receivable, the change in accounts receivable from the beginning to the end of the period is the difference between sales and collections.  

## EFFECT ON STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS  

In General When there is a net decrease in accounts receivable for the period, cash collected from customers is more than revenue; thus, the decrease must be added in computing cash flows from operations. When a net increase in accounts receivable occurs, cash collected from customers is less than revenue; thus, the increase must be subtracted in computing cash flows from operations.\*

Focus Company Analysis The excerpt below shows the Operating Activities section of Skechers’ statement of cash flows. Sales growth outpaced collections during 2019 to result in an increase in Skechers balance in receivables. This increase is subtracted in reconciling net income to cash flow from operating activities because revenues are higher than cash collected from customers for 2019. When receivables decrease, the amount of the decrease in receivables is added in reconciling net income to cash flow from operating activities because cash collected from customers is higher than revenues.

When using the percentage of sales method, you directly compute the bad debt expense for the period by multiplying the amount of credit sales by the bad debt loss rate. With the aging method, you compute the estimated ending balance in the allowance and solve for the bad debt expense. This process involves multiplying the amount in each age category by the estimated percentage uncollectible to produce the estimated ending balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The difference between the estimated ending balance and the balance in the allowance before the adjustment becomes the bad debt expense for the year. Before you move on, try an example of the more difficult aging method computations based on Crocs’s numbers reported in an earlier year.  

1.	 In an earlier year, Skechers’ competitor Crocs reported a beginning balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts of $\Phi5{,}262$ . It also wrote off bad debts amounting to $\mathbb{S}2{,}551$ during the year. At the end of the year, it computed total estimated uncollectible accounts using the aging method to be $\mathbb{S}3{,}973$ (all numbers in thousands of dollars). What amount did Crocs record as bad debt expense for the period? (Solution approach: Use the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts T-account or the following equation to solve for the missing value.)

## REPORTING AND SAFEGUARDING CASH Cash and Cash Equivalents Defined  

Cash is defined as money or any instrument that banks will accept for deposit and immediate credit to a company’s account, such as a check, money order, or bank draft. Cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash and whose value is unlikely to change (i.e., they are not sensitive to interest rate changes).  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 6-4  

Report, control, and safeguard cash.

2. Granting later payment deadlines will most likely decrease the accounts receivable turnover ratio because later collections from customers will increase the average accounts receivable balance (the denominator of the ratio), decreasing the ratio.  

Typical instruments included as cash equivalents are bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills that the U.S. government issues to finance its activities.  

Like most companies, Skechers combines all of its bank accounts and cash equivalents into one amount, Cash and Cash Equivalents, on the balance sheet. It also reports that the book values of cash equivalents on the balance sheet equal their fair market values—which we should expect given the nature of the instruments (investments whose value is unlikely to change).  

## Cash Management  

Many businesses receive a large amount of cash, checks, and credit card receipts from their customers each day. Anyone can spend cash, so management must develop procedures to safeguard the cash it uses in the business. Effective cash management involves more than protecting cash from theft, fraud, or loss through carelessness. Other cash management responsibilities include:  

1.	Accurate accounting so that reports of cash flows and balances may be prepared.   
2.	Controls to ensure that enough cash is available to meet (a) current operating needs, $(b)$ maturing liabilities, and (c) unexpected emergencies.   
3.	Prevention of the accumulation of excess amounts of idle cash. Idle cash earns no revenue. Therefore, it often is invested in securities to earn a return until it is needed for operations.  

## Internal Control of Cash  

Because cash is the asset most vulnerable to theft and fraud, a significant number of internal control procedures should focus on cash. You already have observed internal control procedures for cash, although you may not have known it at the time. At most movie theaters, one employee sells tickets and another employee collects them. Having one employee do both jobs would be less expensive, but that single employee could easily steal cash and admit a patron without issuing a ticket. If different employees perform the tasks, a successful theft requires the participation of both. Effective internal control of cash should include the following:  

1.	Separation of duties.  

![](images/19879343e6f7fe0f7f07bdeab8a4b957398be0db79bf7f621c38d8f4028ac7eb.jpg)  

a.	 Complete separation of the jobs of receiving cash and disbursing cash.   
b.	 Complete separation of the procedures of accounting for cash receipts and cash disbursements. c.	 Complete separation of the physical handling of cash and all phases of the accounting function.   
.	Prescribed policies and procedures. a.	 Require that all cash receipts be deposited in a bank daily. Keep any cash on hand under strict control.   
b.	 Require separate approval of the purchases and the actual cash payments. Prenumbered checks should be used. Special care must be taken with payments by electronic funds transfers because they involve no controlled documents (checks). c.	 Assign the responsibilities for cash payment approval and check-signing or electronic funds transfer transmittal to different individuals. d.	 Require monthly reconciliation of bank accounts with the cash accounts on the company’s books (discussed in detail in the next section).  

## A QUESTION OF ETHICS  

## Ethics and the Need for Internal Control  

Some people are bothered by the recommendation that all well-run companies should have strong internal control procedures. These people believe that control procedures suggest that management does not trust the company’s employees. Although the vast majority of employees are trustworthy, employee theft does cost businesses billions of dollars each year. Interviews with convicted felons indicate that in many cases they stole from their employers because they thought that it was easy and that no one cared (there were no internal control procedures).  

Many companies have a formal code of ethics that requires high standards of behavior in dealing with customers, suppliers, fellow employees, and the company’s assets. Although each employee is ultimately responsible for his or her own ethical behavior, internal control procedures can be thought of as important value statements from management.  

## Reconciliation of the Cash Accounts and the Bank Statements Content of a Bank Statement  

Proper use of the bank accounts can be an important internal cash control procedure. Each month, the bank provides the company (the depositor) with a bank statement. Online banking provides this same information on a daily basis. The bank statement and the online banking site list (1) each paper or electronic deposit recorded by the bank during the period, (2) each paper or electronic payment cleared by the bank during the period, (3) the bank charges or deductions (such as service charges) made directly to the company’s account by the bank, and (4) the balance in the company’s account. A typical bank statement for ROW.COM, Inc., is shown in Exhibit 6.4.  

Exhibit 6.4 lists four items that need explanation. Notice the $\mathbb{S}500$ , $\mathbb{S}100$ , and $\mathbb{S}2,150\$ items listed in the Checks and Debits column and coded EFT.5 This is the code for electronic funds transfers. ROW.COM pays its electricity, rent, and insurance bills using electronic checking. When it orders the electronic payments, it records these items on the company’s books in the same manner as a paper check. So no additional entry is needed.

Notice that listed in the Checks and Debits column there is a deduction for $\mathbb{S}18$ coded NSF. This entry refers to a check for $\mathbb{S}18$ received from a customer and deposited by ROW.COM with its bank. The bank processed the check through banking channels to the customer’s bank, but the account did not have sufficient funds to cover the check. The customer’s bank therefore returned it to ROW.COM’s bank, which then charged it back to ROW.COM’s account. This type of check often is called an NSF check (not sufficient funds). The NSF check is now a receivable; consequently, ROW.COM must make an entry to debit Receivables and credit Cash for the $\mathbb{S}18$ .  

Notice the $\mathbb{S}6$ listed on June 30 in the Checks and Debits column and coded SC. This is the code for bank service charges. The bank statement included a memo by the bank explaining this service charge (which was not documented by a check). ROW.COM must make an entry to reflect this $\mathbb{S}6$ decrease in the bank balance as a debit to a relevant expense account, such as Bank Service Expense, and a credit to Cash.  

Notice the $\mathbb{S}20$ listed on June 18 in the Deposits and Credits column and coded INT for interest earned. The bank pays interest on checking account balances, and it increased ROW.COM’s account for interest earned during the period. ROW.COM must record the interest by making an entry to debit Cash and credit Interest Income for the $\mathbb{S}20$ .  

## Need for Reconciliation  

A bank reconciliation is the process of comparing (reconciling) the ending cash balance in the company’s records and the ending cash balance reported by the bank on the monthly bank statement (or on the online banking site). A bank reconciliation should be completed at the end of each month. Usually, the ending cash balance as shown on the bank statement does not agree with the ending cash balance shown by the related Cash ledger account on the books of the company. For example, the Cash ledger account of ROW.COM showed the following at the end of June (ROW.COM has only one checking account):  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">Cash (A)</td></tr><tr><td>June1balance</td><td>7,753.40</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>June deposits</td><td>5,830.00</td><td>June payments 4,543.40</td></tr><tr><td>Ending balance</td><td>9,040.00</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

The $88,322.20\$ ending cash balance shown on the bank statement (Exhibit 6.4) differs from the $\mathbb{\Phi}{9}\mathrm{{,}}040\mathrm{{.}}00$ ending balance of cash shown on the books of ROW.COM. Most of this difference exists because of timing differences in the recording of transactions:  

1.	Some transactions affecting cash were recorded in the books of ROW.COM but were not shown on the bank statement.   
2.	Some transactions were shown on the bank statement but had not been recorded in the books of ROW.COM.  

Some of the difference also may be caused by errors in recording transactions.  

The most common causes of differences between the ending bank balance and the ending book balance of cash are as follows:  

1.	Outstanding checks. These are checks written by the company and recorded in the company’s ledger as credits to the Cash account that have not cleared the bank (they are not shown on the bank statement as a deduction from the bank balance). The outstanding checks are identified by comparing the list of canceled checks on the bank statement with the record of checks (such as check stubs or a journal) maintained by the company.  

2.	Deposits in transit. These are deposits sent to the bank by the company and recorded in the company’s ledger as debits to the Cash account. The bank has not recorded these deposits (they are not shown on the bank statement as an increase in the bank balance). Deposits in transit usually happen when deposits are made one or two days before the close of the period covered by the bank statement. Deposits in transit are determined by comparing the deposits listed on the bank statement with the company deposit records.  

3.	Bank service charges. These are expenses for bank services listed on the bank statement but not recorded on the company’s books.  

4.	NSF checks. These are “bad checks” or “bounced checks” that have been deposited but must be deducted from the company’s cash account and rerecorded as accounts receivable.  

5.	Interest. This is the interest paid by the bank to the company on its bank balance.  

6.	Errors. Both the bank and the company may make errors, especially when the volume of cash transactions is large.  

## Bank Reconciliation Illustrated  

The general format for the bank reconciliation follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Ending cash balance per books</td><td>$xxx</td><td>Ending cash balance per bank statement</td><td>$xxx</td></tr><tr><td>+ Interest paid by bank</td><td>XX</td><td>+ Depositsintransit</td><td>XX</td></tr><tr><td>-NSF checks/Service charges</td><td>XX</td><td>-Outstanding checks</td><td>XX</td></tr><tr><td>± Company errors</td><td>XX</td><td>± Bank errors</td><td>XX</td></tr><tr><td>Ending correctcashbalance</td><td>$xxx</td><td>Ending gcorrectcashbalance</td><td>$xxx</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Exhibit 6.5 shows the bank reconciliation prepared by ROW.COM for the month of June to reconcile the ending bank balance $(\mathbb{S}8,322.20)$ with the ending book balance $(\mathbb{S}9,040.00)$ . On the completed reconciliation, the correct cash balance is $\mathbb{\Phi}{9}\mathrm{{,}}045\mathrm{{.}}00$ . This correct balance is the amount that should be shown in the Cash account after the reconciliation. Because ROW.COM has only one checking account and no cash on hand, it is also the correct amount of cash that should be reported on the balance sheet.6  

ROW.COM followed these steps in preparing the bank reconciliation:  

1.	Identify the outstanding checks. A comparison of the checks and electronic payments listed on the bank statement with the company’s record of all checks drawn and electronic payments made showed the following checks were still outstanding (had not cleared the bank) at the end of June:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Check No.</td><td>Amount</td></tr><tr><td>121</td><td>$ 145.00</td></tr><tr><td>123</td><td>815.00</td></tr><tr><td>131</td><td>117.20</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>$1,077.20</td></tr></table></body></html>  

This total was entered on the reconciliation as a deduction from the bank account.   
These checks will be deducted by the bank when they clear the bank.

Bank Reconciliation For the Month Ending June 30, 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Company's Books</td><td colspan="2">Bank Statement</td></tr><tr><td>Ending cash balance per books</td><td>$9,040.00</td><td>Ending cash balance per bank statement $8,322.20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Additions Interest paid by the bank Error in recording payment</td><td>Additions</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>20.00 Deposit in transit</td><td>1,800.00</td></tr><tr><td>9.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9,069.00</td><td>10,122.20</td></tr><tr><td>Deductions</td><td>Deductions</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>NSFcheckofR.Smith</td><td>18.00 Outstanding checks</td><td>1,077.20</td></tr><tr><td>Bankservicecharges</td><td>6.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ending correct cash balance</td><td>$9,045.00 Endingcorrectcashbalance</td><td>$9,045.00</td></tr></table></body></html>  

2.	Identify the deposits in transit. A comparison of the deposit slips on hand with those listed on the bank statement revealed that a deposit of $\mathbb{S}1{,}800$ made on June 30 was not listed on the bank statement. This amount was entered on the reconciliation as an addition to the bank account. It will be added by the bank when it records the deposit.  

## 3.	Record bank charges and credits:  

a.	 Interest received from the bank, $\mathbb{S}20.$ —entered on the bank reconciliation as an addition to the book balance; it already has been included in the bank balance. b.	 NSF check of R. Smith, $\mathbb{S}18\cdot$ —entered on the bank reconciliation as a deduction from the book balance; it has been deducted from the bank balance. c.	 Bank service charges, $\mathbb{S}6.$ —entered on the bank reconciliation as a deduction from the book balance; it has been deducted from the bank balance.  

4.	Determine the impact of errors. At this point, ROW.COM found that the reconciliation did not balance by $^{\mathbb{S}9}$ . Upon checking the journal entries made during the month, the electronic payment on June 9 for $\mathbb{S}100$ to pay an account payable was found. The payment was recorded in the company’s accounts as $\mathbb{S}109$ . Therefore, $^{\mathbb{S}9}$ (i.e., $\mathbb{S}109\mathrm{~-~}$ $\mathbb{S}100)$ ) must be added to the book cash balance on the reconciliation; the bank cleared the electronic payment for the correct amount, $\mathbb{S}100$ .  

Note that in Exhibit 6.5 the two sections of the bank reconciliation now agree at a correct cash balance of $\mathbb{\Phi}{9}\mathrm{{,}}045\mathrm{{.}}00$ .  

A bank reconciliation as shown in Exhibit 6.5 accomplishes two major objectives:  

1.	It checks the accuracy of the bank balance and the company cash records, which involves developing the correct cash balance. The correct cash balance (plus cash on hand, if any) is the amount of cash that is reported on the balance sheet.   
2.	It identifies any previously unrecorded transactions or changes that are necessary to cause the company’s Cash account(s) to show the correct cash balance. Any transactions or changes on the company’s books side of the bank reconciliation need journal entries. Therefore, the following journal entries based on the company’s books side of the bank reconciliation (Exhibit 6.5) must be entered into the company’s records:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>(a) Cash (+A)</td><td>20</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Interest income (+R,+SE)</td><td></td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Torecordinterestbybank.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(b)Accountsreceivable(+A)</td><td>18</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>TorecordNSFcheck.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(c)Bankserviceexpense(+E,-SE)</td><td>6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Torecord servicefeeschargedbybank.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(d) Cash (+A)</td><td>9</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Accounts payable (+L) Tocorrecterrormadeinrecordingacheckpayabletoacreditor.</td><td></td><td>6</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Assets</td><td>Liabilities</td><td>十 Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Cash (+20,-18,-6,+9) +5</td><td>Accountspayable +9</td><td>Interest income (+R) +20</td></tr><tr><td>Accountsreceivable +18</td><td></td><td>Bank service expense (+E) -6</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Notice again that all of the additions and deductions on the company’s books side of the reconciliation need journal entries to update the Cash account. The additions and deductions on the bank statement side do not need journal entries because they will work out automatically when they clear the bank.  

Cash is the most liquid of all assets, flowing continually into and out of a business. As a result, a number of critical control procedures, including the reconciliation of bank accounts, should be applied. Also, management of cash may be critically important to decision makers who must have cash available to meet current needs yet must avoid excess amounts of idle cash that produce no revenue. To see if you understand the basics of a bank reconciliation, answer the following questions:  

S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z  

Indicate which of the following items discovered while preparing a company’s bank reconciliation will result in adjustment of the cash balance on the balance sheet.  

1.	 Outstanding checks.   
2.	 Deposits in transit.   
3.	 Bank service charges.   
4.	 NSF checks that were deposited.

(Complete the requirements before proceeding to the suggested solutions.) Wholesale Warehouse Stores sold $\mathbb{S}950{,}000$ in merchandise during 2022. Of this amount, $\mathbb{S}400{,}000$ was on credit with terms $2/10$ , $\mathfrak{n}/30$ (75 percent of these amounts were paid within the discount period), $\mathbb{S}500{,}000$ was paid with credit cards (there was a 3 percent credit card discount), and the rest was paid in cash. On December 31, 2022 The Accounts Receivable balance was $\mathbb{S}80{,}000$ . The beginning balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was $\mathbb{S}9{,}000$ and $\mathbb{S}6{,}000$ of bad debts was written off during the year.  

## Required:  

1.	 Compute net sales for 2022, assuming that sales and credit card discounts are treated as contra-revenues.   
2.	 Assume that Wholesale uses the percentage of sales method for estimating bad debt expense and that it estimates that 2 percent of credit sales will produce bad debts. Record bad debt expense for 2022.   
3.	 Assume instead that Wholesale uses the aging of accounts receivable method and that it estimates that $\mathbb{S}10{,}000$ worth of current accounts is uncollectible. Record bad debt expense for 2022.  

## SUGGESTED SOLUTION  

1.	 Both sales discounts and credit card discounts should be subtracted from sales revenues in the computation of net sales.  

Sales revenue \$950,000   
Less: Sales discounts $(0.02\times0.75\times\mathbb{9}400,000)$ 6,000

(Complete the requirements before proceeding to the suggested solution that follows.) Laura Anne Long, a freshman at a large state university, has just received her first checking account statement. This was her first chance to attempt a bank reconciliation. She had the following information to work with:  

Bank balance, September 1 \$1,150   
Deposits during September 650   
Checks cleared during September 900   
Bank service charge 25   
Bank balance, October 1 875  

Laura was surprised that the deposit of $\mathbb{S}50$ she made on September 29 had not been posted to her account and was pleased that her rent check of $\mathbb{S}200$ had not cleared her account. Her checkbook balance on October 1 was $\mathbb{S}750$ .  

## Required:  

1.	 Complete Laura’s bank reconciliation.   
2.	 Why is it important for individuals such as Laura and businesses to do a bank reconciliation each month?  

## SUGGESTED SOLUTION  

1.	 Laura’s bank reconciliation:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">Laura'sBooks</td></tr><tr><td>October1cashbalance Additions</td><td>$750</td><td>BankStatement October1cashbalance $875 Additions</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td></td><td>Depositintransit 50</td></tr><tr><td>Deductions Bankservicecharge</td><td>Deductions Outstanding check</td><td>(200)</td></tr><tr><td>Correctcashbalance</td><td>(25) $725</td><td>Correctcashbalance $725</td></tr></table></body></html>  

2.	 Bank statements, whether personal or business, should be reconciled each month. This process helps ensure that a correct balance is reflected in the account owner’s books. Failure to reconcile a bank statement increases the chance that an error will not be discovered and may result in bad checks being written. Businesses must reconcile their bank statements for an additional reason: The correct balance that is calculated during reconciliation is recorded on the balance sheet.  

## Chapter Supplement  

## Recording Discounts and Returns  

Credit card discounts and cash discounts must be recorded as contra-revenues that reduce reported net sales. For example, if the credit card company is charging a 3 percent fee for its service and Skechers’ online credit card sales are $\mathbb{S}3{,}000$ for January 2, Skechers will record the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Cash (+A)</td><td>2,910</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Creditcard discount(+XR,-R,-SE)</td><td>90</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Sales revenue (+R,+SE)</td><td></td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Assets Liabilities</td><td colspan="2">Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">+ Cash +2,910 Creditcard discount(+XR)</td><td colspan="2">Sales revenue (+R) +3,000 -90</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Similarly, if credit sales of $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ are recorded with terms $2/10,\,\mathrm{n}/30$ $\mathbb{5}1,000\times0.98=\mathbb{5}980$ ) and payment is made within the discount period, Skechers will record the following:  

![](images/ab0dd63a3e4975eae4b5c75173762180a6e5f597283c1649b1171ed3f3f677c0.jpg)  
Cash $+980$ Sales discount $(+\Chi\mathsf{R})$ −20   
Accounts receivable −1,000  

Sales returns and allowances should always be treated as a contra-revenue that reduces net sales. Assume that Dick’s Sporting Goods buys 40 pairs of shoes from Skechers for $\mathbb{S}2{,}000$ on account. On the date of sale, Skechers makes the following journal entry:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Accounts receivable(+A)</td><td>2,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Salesrevenue (+R,+SE)</td><td></td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities 一</td><td colspan="2">+ Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Before paying for the shoes, however, Dick’s Sporting Goods discovers that 10 pairs of shoes are not the color ordered and returns them to Skechers. On that date Skechers records:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Salesreturnsandallowances (+XR,-R,-SE)</td><td>500</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Accounts receivable (-A)</td><td></td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities 十</td><td colspan="2">Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Accounts receivable −500 Sales returns and allowances $\mathrm{+XR})$ ) −500  

In addition, the related cost of goods sold entry for the 10 pairs of shoes would be reversed.

6-1.	 Analyze the impact of credit card sales, sales discounts, sales returns, and sales of bundled items on the amounts reported as net sales. p. 293  

Credit card discounts and sales or cash discounts must be recorded as contra-revenues that reduce net sales. Sales returns and allowances, which also should be treated as a contra-revenue, also reduce net sales. Sales of bundled items must be accounted for using the five-step process to allocate sales price to performance obligations.  

6-2.	 Estimate, report, and evaluate the effects of uncollectible accounts receivable (bad debts) on financial statements. p. 298  

When receivables are material, companies must employ the allowance method to account for uncollectibles. These are the steps in the process:  

a.	 The end-of-period adjusting entry to record bad debt expense estimates. b.	 Writing off specific accounts determined to be uncollectible during the period. The adjusting entry reduces net income as well as net accounts receivable. The related expense must be recorded as an operating expense. The write-off affects neither net income nor net accounts receivable.  

6-3.	 Analyze and interpret the receivables turnover ratio and the effects of accounts receivable on cash flows. p. 303  

a.	 Receivables turnover ratio—This ratio measures the effectiveness of credit-granting and collection activities. It reflects how many times average trade receivables were recorded and collected during the period. Analysts and creditors watch this ratio because a sudden decline in it may mean that a company is extending payment deadlines in an attempt to prop up lagging sales or is recording sales that later will be returned by customers.   
b.	 Effects on cash flows—When a net decrease in accounts receivable for the period occurs, cash collected from customers is always more than revenue and cash flows from operations increase. When a net increase in accounts receivable occurs, cash collected from customers is always less than revenue. Thus, cash flows from operations decline.  

6-4. Report, control, and safeguard cash. p. 307  

Cash is the most liquid of all assets, flowing continually into and out of a business. As a result, a number of critical control procedures, including the reconciliation of bank accounts, should be applied. Also, management of cash may be critically important to decision makers, who must have cash available to meet current needs yet must avoid excess amounts of idle cash that produce no revenue.  

Closely related to recording revenue is recording the cost of what was sold. Chapter 7 will focus on transactions related to inventory and cost of goods sold. This topic is important because cost of goods sold has a major impact on a company’s gross profit and net income, which are watched closely by investors, analysts, and other users of financial statements. Increasing emphasis on quality, productivity, and costs have further focused production managers’ attention on cost of goods sold and inventory. Because inventory cost figures play a major role in product introduction and pricing decisions, they also are important to marketing and general managers. Finally, because inventory accounting has a major effect on many companies’ tax liabilities, this is an important place to introduce the effect of taxation on management decision making and financial reporting.  

Receivables turnover ratio measures the effectiveness of credit-granting and collection activities. It is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Measuring and Reporting Receivables section):  

_N__et_ _S_al_e_s Receivables Turnover = ​ Average Ne t T rade Ac coun ts Re ceivable ​

During the current year, Bob’s Ceramics Shop had sales revenue of $\mathbb{S}60{,}000$ , of which $\mathbb{S}25{,}000$ was on credit. At the start of the current year, Accounts Receivable showed a $\mathbb{S}3{,}500$ debit balance and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts showed a $\mathbb{S}300$ credit balance. Collections of accounts receivable during the current year amounted to $\mathbb{S}18{,}000$ .  

Data during the current year follow:  

a.	 On December 31, an Account Receivable (Toby’s Gift Shop) of $\mathbb{S}550$ from a prior year was determined to be uncollectible; therefore, it was written off immediately as a bad debt.  

b.	 On December 31, on the basis of experience, a decision was made to continue the accounting policy of basing estimated bad debt losses on 2 percent of credit sales for the year.  

## Required:  

1.	 Give the required journal entries for the two items on December 31, the end of the accounting period. 2.	 Show how the amounts related to Accounts Receivable and Bad Debt Expense would be reported on the income statement and balance sheet for the current year. Disregard income tax considerations. 3.	 On the basis of the data available, does the 2 percent rate appear to be reasonable? Explain.  

## Recording, Reporting, and Evaluating a Bad Debt Estimate Using Aging Analysis  

Brown Cow Dairy uses the aging approach to estimate bad debt expense. The ending balance of each account receivable is aged on the basis of three time periods as follows: (1) not yet due, $\mathbb{S}14{,}000$ ; (2) up to 120 days past due, $\mathbb{S}4{,}500$ ; and (3) more than 120 days past due, $\mathbb{S}2{,}500$ . Experience has shown that for each age group, the average loss rate on the amount of the receivables at year-end due to uncollectibility is (1) 2 percent, (2) 12 percent, and (3) 30 percent, respectively. At December 31 (end of the current year), the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts balance is $\mathbb{S}800$ (credit) before the end-of-period adjusting entry is made. Data during the current year follow:  

a.	 During December, an Account Receivable (Patty’s Bake Shop) of $\mathbb{S}750$ from a prior sale was determined to be uncollectible; therefore, it was written off immediately as a bad debt. b.	 On December 31, the appropriate adjusting entry for the year was recorded.  

## Required:  

1.	 Give the required journal entries for the two items listed above.   
2.	 Show how the amounts related to Accounts Receivable and Bad Debt Expense would be reported on the income statement and balance sheet for the current year. Disregard income tax considerations.   
3.	 On the basis of the data available, does the estimate resulting from the aging analysis appear to be reasonable? Explain.

## Interpreting the Effects of Sales Declines and Changes in Receivables on Cash Flow from Operations  

Tupperware Brands Corporation is engaged in the marketing, manufacture, and sale of design-centric preparation, storage and serving solutions for the kitchen and home and beauty products through international brands. Assume that two recent years produced a combination of declining sales revenue and net income, culminating in a net income of only $\mathbb{S}12{,}400$ (all numbers in thousands). Yet Tupperware was able to report positive cash flows from operations in the current year of $\mathbb{S}87{,}400$ . Contributing to that positive cash flow was the change in accounts receivable. The current and prior years’ balance sheets reported the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">amounts in thousands</td></tr><tr><td>Ci urrent Year</td><td>Prior Year</td></tr><tr><td>Accountsreceivable,netof allowances</td><td>$110,700</td><td>$144,700</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Required:  

1.	 On the current year’s cash flow statement (indirect method), how would the change in accounts receivable affect cash flow from operations? Explain why it would have this effect.   
2.	 Explain how declining sales revenue often leads to (a) declining accounts receivable and $(b)$ ) cash collections from customers being higher than sales revenue.

## Determining Bad Debt Expense Based on Aging Analysis (AP6-3)  

Blue Skies Equipment Company uses the aging approach to estimate bad debt expense at the end of each accounting year. Credit sales occur frequently on terms $\ensuremath{\mathrm{n}}/60$ . The balance of each account receivable is aged on the basis of three time periods as follows: (1) not yet due, (2) up to one year past due, and (3) more than one year past due. Experience has shown that for each age group, the average loss rate on the amount of the receivable at year-end due to uncollectibility is (a) 3 percent, (b) 9 percent, and (c) 28 percent, respectively.  

At December 31, 2022 (end of the current accounting year), the Accounts Receivable balance was $^{\S48,700}$ and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts balance was $\mathbb{S}920$ (credit). In determining which accounts have been paid, the company applies collections to the oldest sales first. To simplify, only five customer accounts are used; the details of each on December 31, 2022, follow:

## Determining Bad Debt Expense Based on Aging Analysis (P6-3)  

Assume that Witz and Steenhoven, Inc. uses the aging approach to estimate bad debt expense at the end of each accounting year. Credit sales occur frequently on terms $\mathrm{n}/45$ . The balance of each account receivable is aged on the basis of four time periods as follows: (1) not yet due, (2) up to 6 months past due, (3) 6 to 12 months past due, and (4) more than 1 year past due. Experience has shown that for each age group, the average loss rate on the amount of the receivable at year-end due to uncollectibility is (a) 1 percent, (b) 5 percent, (c) 20 percent, and (d) 50 percent, respectively.  

At December 31, 2022 (end of the current accounting year), the Accounts Receivable balance was $\mathbb{5}39{,}500$ and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts balance was $\mathbb{S}1{,}550$ (credit). In determining which accounts have been paid, the company applies collections to the oldest sales first. To simplify, only five customer accounts are used; the details of each on December 31, 2022, follow:

## Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma: Management Incentives, Revenue Recognition, and Sales with the Right of Return  

Symbol Technologies, Inc.  

Symbol Technologies, Inc., was a fast-growing maker of bar-code scanners. According to the federal charges, Tomo Razmilovic, the CEO at Symbol, was obsessed with meeting the stock market’s expectation for continued growth. His executive team responded by improperly recording revenue and allowances for returns, as well as a variety of other tricks, to overstate revenues by $\mathbb{S}230$ million and pretax earnings by $\mathbb{S}530$ million. What makes this fraud nearly unique is that virtually the whole senior management team was charged with participating in the six-year fraud. In April 2015, the SEC settled with the last of the 13 Symbol executives that were defendants in the case. Razmilovic, the former CEO, fled the country to avoid prosecution and was still at large at the time of the final settlement. The exact nature of the fraud is described in the following excerpts from the SEC civil complaint. Concerning sales of goods, the complaint alleged that “Defendant Borghese, Symbol’s former head of sales, spearheaded the revenue recognition fraud. Whenever actual sales fell short of Razmilovic’s target, Borghese stuffed the distribution channel by granting resellers return rights and contingent payment terms in side agreements that he negotiated or authorized. . . . In addition, Borghese employed multiple schemes for claiming revenue before it was earned, such as shipping the wrong product when the product ordered by the customer was unavailable. . . . In a related scheme that Burke originated, Mortenson and Donlon also caused revenue to be recognized in several quarters on shipments that did not occur until the next quarter. To conceal this premature recognition of revenue, Mortenson and Donlon, acting at the direction of Borghese and others, secured backdated phony ‘bill and hold’ letters from the customers.”  

Concerning sales of service, the complaint alleged that “Defendant Heuschneider, finance director for Symbol’s customer service division, artificially inflated the service revenue reported by Symbol . . . by directing subordinates to make multimillion dollar fraudulent entries that improperly accelerated revenue recognition on existing service contracts. Heuschneider also fabricated revenue by improperly ‘renewing’ dormant or cancelled service contracts without the customer’s approval.”

Dated: New York, New York June 3, 2004.  

Required:  

1.	 What facts, if any, presented in the complaint suggest that Symbol violated the revenue recognition principle?   
2.	 Assuming that Symbol did recognize revenue when goods were shipped, how could it have properly accounted for the fact that customers had a right to cancel the contracts (make an analogy with accounting for bad debts)?   
3.	 What do you think may have motivated management to falsify the statements? Why was management concerned with reporting continued growth in net income?   
4.	 Explain who was hurt by management’s unethical conduct.   
5.	 Assume that you are the auditor for other firms. After reading about the fraud, what types of transactions would you pay special attention to in the audit of your clients in this industry? What ratio might provide warnings about possible channel stuffing?

## Evaluating Internal Control  

Cripple Creek Company has one trusted employee who, as the owner said, “handles all of the bookkeeping and paperwork for the company.” This employee is responsible for counting, verifying, and recording cash receipts and payments; making the weekly bank deposit; preparing checks for major expenditures (signed by the owner); making small expenditures from the cash register for daily expenses; and collecting accounts receivable. The owners asked the local bank for a $\mathbb{S}20{,}000$ loan. The bank asked that an audit be performed covering the year just ended. The independent auditor (a local CPA), in a private conference with the owner, presented some evidence of the following activities of the trusted employee during the past year.  

a.	 Cash sales sometimes were not entered in the cash register and the trusted employee pocketed approximately $\mathbb{S}50$ per month.   
b.	 Cash taken from the cash register (and pocketed by the trusted employee) was replaced with expense memos with fictitious signatures (approximately $\mathbb{S}12$ per day).   
c.	 A $\mathbb{S}300$ collection on an account receivable of a valued out-of-town customer was pocketed by the trusted employee and was covered by making a $\mathbb{S}300$ entry as a debit to Sales Returns and a credit to Accounts Receivable.   
d.	 An $\mathbb{S}800$ collection on an account receivable from a local customer was pocketed by the trusted employee and was covered by making an $\mathbb{S}800$ entry as a debit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and a credit to Accounts Receivable.  

Required:  

1.	 What was the approximate amount stolen during the past year?   
2.	 What would be your recommendations to the owner?
