# Ch02 Investing and Financing Decisions and the Accounting System   

ntrepreneur and chef Steve Ells had a vision for a restaurant that serves food fast but uses higher-quality fresh ingredients and classic cooking techniques found in finer restaurants. In 1993, he borrowed $^{\Phi85,000}$ cash from his family to open his first Chipotle Mexican Grill in a former Dolly Madison ice cream store in Denver, Colorado. Chipotle Mexican Grill soon became a leader in the “fast-casual” segment of the restaurant industry. As of March 31, 2020, the Chipotle chain operated nearly 2,600 restaurants in the United States, 40 internationally, and three non-Chipotle restaurants called Pizzeria Locale following a similar business model.  

How did Chipotle grow so fast? First, Chipotle’s mission to provide “Food with Integrity” jump-started its tremendous growth. It was committed to making meals with fresh food, using responsibly raised meat, and purchasing organic produce and dairy products from local farmers, which appealed to customers who were beginning to demand healthier food options. Then, in 1999, McDonald’s Corporation became the majority stockholder by investing about $\Phi360$ million in Chipotle. This provided funding for its early growth from 19 stores to nearly 490 restaurants by the end of 2005. In January 2006, Chipotle “went public.” In its IPO, or initial public offering, it issued stock to the public for the first time (listed on the New York Stock Exchange as CMG). Then, McDonald’s spun off (sold its ownership in) Chipotle for nearly $\Phi1.4$ billion—a handsome profit of over $\Phi1$ billion.

The $\Phi\boldsymbol{1}73$ million Chipotle raised from its IPO along with its operating profits funded additional store growth. It also has invested in enhancing information technology to meet the increasing need for digital engagement, including mobile and artificial intelligence (AI) ordering and marketing. The company uses the AI information, for example, to add new assembly lines for processing online and delivery orders when needed. It announced in June 2020 that it is partnering with GrubHub to expand its delivery footprint, and, in July 2020, it said that 60 percent of its new restaurants will feature a drive-through, or “Chipotlane”—Chipotle continues to invest in its buildings, equipment, and technology for future growth.  

## UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS  

The “fast-casual” segment of the $\Phi4$ trillion global restaurant industry generates approximately $\Phi60$ billion in sales annually. What identifies a restaurant as fast-casual? Typically, customers can order online, use the digital app, or order in person. However, unlike fast food restaurants, the food is made to order, typically in view of the customers and without full table service, and is served in modern and upscale surroundings, with checks typically ranging between $\Phi8$ and $\Phi16$ . Chipotle Mexican Grill has been a leader in this segment, although competition has increased and growth in this industry segment has slowed in recent years.

the right to use or sell a product or service to another. This is an easy way for someone to start his or her own business because the franchisor (the seller, such as Noodles & Company) often provides site location, design, marketing, and management training support in exchange for initial franchise fees and ongoing royalty fees usually based on weekly sales. At Noodles & Company, for example, only 85 percent of the stores are company-owned.  

Unlike most restaurant chains, however, Chipotle does not franchise the business. All restaurants are company-owned. Developing a new site, usually on rented or leased property, costs on average about $\Phi835,000$ . In 2019, Chipotle spent nearly $\Phi334{\mathrm{~mil}}.$ - lion on new and renovated property and equipment. The creation of new restaurants to meet consumer demand for healthier food options explains most of the changes in Chipotle’s assets and liabilities from year to year. To understand how the result of Chipotle Mexican Grill’s growth strategy is communicated in the balance sheet, we must answer the following questions:  

•	 What business activities cause changes in the balance sheet amounts from one period to the next? •	 How do specific business activities affect each of the balance sheet amounts? •	 How do companies keep track of the balance sheet amounts?  

In the first chapter, you learned about the importance of accounting in business decisions and the structure of basic financial statements, their relationships, and key terms. The next three chapters build on Chapter 1 as we use Chipotle’s activities to illustrate new tools and concepts necessary to develop, report, and use real financial statements. In this chapter, we focus on some common asset acquisition activities (often called investing activities), along with related financing activities, such as borrowing funds from creditors or selling stock to investors to provide the cash necessary to acquire the assets. Operating activities that affect both the income statement and the balance sheet are covered in Chapters 3 and 4. Let’s begin with the basic concepts related to measuring and reporting these activities.

ORGANIZATION OF THE CHAPTER  

## WHAT INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IN THE BALANCE SHEET?  

## Recognition and Measurement Concepts  

Before we discuss accountants’ definitions for the elements of the balance sheet, we should consider three assumptions and a measurement concept that underlie much of our application of these definitions. First, the separate entity assumption states that each business’s activities must be accounted for separately from the personal activities of its owners, all other persons, and other entities. This means, for example, that, when an owner purchases property for personal use, the property is not an asset of the business. Second, under the going concern assumption (also called the continuity assumption), unless there is evidence to the contrary, we assume that the business will continue operating into the foreseeable future, long enough to meet its contractual commitments and plans. This means, for example, that if there was a high likelihood of bankruptcy, then its assets should be valued and reported on the balance sheet as if the company were to be liquidated (that is, discontinued, with all of its assets sold and all debts paid). Under the monetary unit assumption, each business entity accounts for and reports its financial results primarily in terms of the national monetary unit (e.g., dollars in the United States, yen in Japan, and euros in Germany), without any adjustment for changes in purchasing power (e.g., inflation).  

Finally, accountants measure the elements of the balance sheet initially at their cost (historical cost), which is the cash-equivalent value on the date of the transaction. For example, assets are initially recorded on the exchange date at the cash paid plus the dollar value of all noncash considerations, such as the trade-in value of a used asset. We will discuss the conditions under which these values are adjusted to other amounts, such as their market value, starting in Chapter 6 of this text. With these assumptions in mind, we are now ready to discuss accountants’ definitions of the elements of the balance sheet.  

## Elements of the Balance Sheet  

The four financial statements—balance sheet, income statement, statement of stockholders’ (shareholders’ or owners’) equity, and statement of cash flows—along with the notes to the statements provide the structure for the information communicated to users. As we learned in Chapter 1, assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity are the elements of a corporation’s balance sheet. The conceptual framework defines them as follows.  

## Assets  

Assets are economic resources owned or controlled by a company; they have measurable value and are expected to benefit the company by producing cash inflows or reducing cash outflows in the future. As shown in Chipotle’s balance sheet presented in Exhibit 2.1, most companies list assets in order of liquidity, or how soon an asset is expected by management to be turned into cash or used. Notice that several of Chipotle’s assets are categorized as current assets. Current assets are those resources that Chipotle will use or turn into cash within one year (the next 12 months). Chipotle’s current assets include Cash, Short-Term Investments (in the stocks and bonds of other companies), Accounts Receivable (due from customers and others), Supplies (to make and serve the food), and Prepaid Expenses (for rent, insurance, and advertising paid in advance of use). For manufacturers that produce and sell goods and merchandisers who sell already-completed goods, Inventory (for goods to be sold) also would be listed after Accounts Receivable. Inventory is always considered a current asset, regardless of how long it takes to produce and sell the inventory. Another common account title is Other Current Assets, which is a summary of several smaller accounts. These are typical titles used by most entities.  

All other assets are considered long term (or noncurrent). That is, they are to be used or turned into cash after the coming year. For Chipotle, that includes property and equipment (Land, Buildings, and Equipment), Operating lease right-of-use assets (for rented facilities, primarily stores in shopping centers), and Intangibles (nonphysical assets such as trademarks and patents) used over several years. Chipotle also may acquire the stocks and bonds of other companies as Long-Term Investments, discussed in detail in Appendix A.

## Liabilities  

Liabilities are defined as measurable obligations resulting from a past transaction; they are expected to be settled in the future by transferring assets or providing services. Entities that a company owes money to are called creditors.  

Similar to how assets are reported in order of liquidity, liabilities are usually listed on the balance sheet in order of maturity (how soon an obligation is to be paid). Liabilities that Chipotle will need to pay or settle within the coming year (with cash, goods, other current assets, or services) are classified as current liabilities. Chipotle’s current liabilities include Accounts Payable (to suppliers), Unearned Revenue (for unredeemed gift cards that have been purchased by customers), Accrued Expenses Payable (more specifically, Wages Payable and Utilities Payable, although additional accrued liabilities may include Interest Payable, among others) and Current Lease Liabilities representing the current amount owed on leases from renting facilities, for example, in shopping centers. Companies may also include Income Taxes Payable (due to federal, state, and local governments) and Other Current Liabilities (a summary of several smaller accounts). Distinguishing current assets and current liabilities assists external users of the financial statements in assessing the amounts and the timing of future cash flows.  

Chipotle’s noncurrent liabilities include Notes Payable (written promises to pay the amount borrowed and interest as specified in the signed agreement) and Long-term Lease Liabilities (the amount owed beyond the next 12 months for rent of buildings).  

## Stockholders’ Equity  

Stockholders’ equity (also called shareholders’ equity or owners’ equity) is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after subtracting liabilities. It is a combination of the financing provided by the owners and by business operations.  

•	 Financing Provided by Owners is referred to as contributed capital. Owners invest in the business by providing cash and sometimes other assets, receiving in exchange shares of stock as evidence of ownership. The largest investors in Chipotle’s stock are financial institutions (mutual funds, pension funds, etc.). The directors and executive officers also own stock, as do other corporate employees and the general public. Common Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital are the accounts used to represent the amount investors paid to Chipotle when they purchased the stock from the company. Note, however, that the Treasury Stock account reduces stockholders’ equity. Treasury Stock represents the amount Chipotle paid to its investors when the company repurchased from investors a portion of previously issued common stock. Treasury Stock will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 11.  

•	 Financing Provided by Operations is referred to as earned capital or retained earnings. When companies earn profits, they can be distributed to owners as dividends or reinvested in the business. The portion of profits reinvested in the business is called Retained Earnings. Companies with a growth strategy, such as Chipotle, often pay little or no dividends to retain funds for expansion. A look at Chipotle’s balance sheet (Exhibit 2.1) indicates that its growth has been financed by substantial reinvestment of earnings ( $^{\leftmoon,916}$ million).  

We just learned the elements of the balance sheet (assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity) and how assets and liabilities are usually classified (current or noncurrent). Current assets (including inventory) are expected to be used or turned into cash within the next 12 months and current liabilities are expected to be paid or satisfied within the next 12 months with cash, services, or other current assets.

## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2-2  

Identify what constitutes a business transaction and recognize common balance sheet account titles used in business.  

## Unrecorded but Valuable Assets and Liabilities  

Many very valuable intangible assets, such as trademarks, patents, and copyrights that are developed inside a company (not purchased), are not reported on the balance sheet. For example, Facebook’s balance sheet reveals no listing for the Facebook trademark because it was developed internally over time through research, development, and advertising (it was not purchased). Likewise, the Coca-Cola Company does not report any asset for its patented Coke formula, although it does report more than $\mathbb{S}9.2$ billion in various trademarks that it has purchased.  

Many large companies have some form of off-balance-sheet financing—obligations not reported as liabilities on the balance sheet. For example, Chipotle’s recent 10-K states that “leases with an initial term of 12 months or less . . . are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.” The notes to the financial statements indicated that the company incurred about $\mathbb{S}3$ million in short-term lease cost out of about ${\mathbb S}345$ million. This illustrates the importance of reading the notes, not just the financial statements, when analyzing a company’s financial information and predicting future cash flows.  

Now that we have reviewed the basic elements of the balance sheet and related recognition and measurement concepts as part of the conceptual framework, let’s see what economic activities cause changes in the amounts reported on the balance sheet.  

## WHAT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES CAUSE CHANGES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS?  

## Nature of Business Transactions  

Accounting focuses on certain events that have an economic impact on the entity. Those events that are recorded as part of the accounting process are called transactions. The first step in translating the results of business events to financial statement numbers is determining which events to include. As the definitions of assets and liabilities indicate, only economic resources and obligations resulting from past transactions are recorded on the balance sheet. Transactions include two types of events:  

1.	External events: These are exchanges of assets, goods, or services by one party for assets, services, or promises to pay (liabilities) from one or more other parties. Examples include the purchase of a machine from a supplier for cash, sale of merchandise to customers on account (store credit), borrowing of cash from a bank and signing a promissory note for repayment, and investment of cash in the business by the owners in exchange for ownership shares.  

a. SE b. CA c. CA d. CA e. SE f. NCL g. CL h. NCA i. CL 2.	Internal events: These include certain events that are not exchanges between the business and other parties but nevertheless have a direct and measurable effect on the entity. Examples include using up insurance paid in advance and using buildings and equipment over several years.  

Throughout this textbook, the word transaction is used in the broad sense to include both types of events.  

Some important events that have a future economic impact on a company, however, are not reflected in the financial statements. In most cases, signing a contract is not considered to be an accounting transaction because it involves only the exchange of promises, not of assets such as cash, goods, services, or property. For example, assume that Chipotle signs an employment contract with a new regional manager. From an accounting perspective, no transaction has occurred because no exchange of assets, goods, or services has been made. Each party to the contract has exchanged promises—the manager agrees to work; Chipotle agrees to pay the manager for the work. For each day the new manager works, however, the exchange of services for pay results in a transaction that Chipotle must record. Because of their importance, long-term employment contracts and other commitments may need to be disclosed in notes to the financial statements.  

## Accounts  

To accumulate the dollar effect of transactions on each financial statement item, organizations use a standardized format called an account. The resulting balances are kept separate for financial statement purposes. To facilitate the recording of transactions, each company establishes a chart of accounts, a list of all account titles and their unique numbers. The accounts are usually organized by financial statement element, with asset accounts listed first, followed by liability, stockholders’ equity, revenue, and expense accounts in that order. Exhibit 2.2 lists various account titles that are quite common and are used by most companies. The exhibit also provides special notes to help you in learning account titles. When you are completing assignments and are unsure of an account title, refer to this listing for help.  

Every company creates its own chart of accounts to fit the nature of its business activities. For example, a small lawn care service may have an asset account titled Lawn Mowing Equipment, but  

![](images/fc041785a1c65f05e45565d7f5defc42c23e8a592112bcc4be57a05f5cba5fe4.jpg)  

A recordable transaction occurs when assets, goods, or services are either received or given. An exchange of two promises does not make a transaction.  

![](images/eb6d5c117d679dd0ddec7379f9a081188fb89d88ee0ed7043c6519a8c2d9b3b7.jpg)  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2-3  

Apply transaction analysis to simple business transactions in terms of the accounting model: Assets $=$ Liabilities $^+$ Stockholders’ Equity.  

a large corporation such as Dell is unlikely to report such an account on its balance sheet. These differences in accounts will become more apparent as we examine the balance sheets of various companies. Because each company has its own chart of accounts, you should not try to memorize a typical chart of accounts, but focus instead on understanding the nature of each typical account by where it is located in the financial statements. Then when you see a company that uses a slightly different title, you will understand what it means. For example, some companies use the terms Trade Accounts Receivable (same as Accounts Receivable) or Merchandise Inventory (same as Inventory). In homework problems, you will either be given the account names or be expected to select appropriate names, similar to the ones in Exhibit 2.2. Once you select a name for an account, you must use that exact name in all transactions affecting that account.  

The accounts you see in the financial statements of most large corporations are actually summations (or aggregations) of a number of specific accounts in their recordkeeping system. For example, Chipotle keeps separate accounts for food, beverage, and packaging supplies but combines them under Supplies on the balance sheet. Wages Payable under Accrued Expenses Payable summarizes several accounts with smaller balances related to workers’ compensation liability and other benefits owed to employees such as medical, dental, and vision health insurance, paid meal breaks, tuition reimbursement, life insurance, and free burritos.  

## HOW DO TRANSACTIONS AFFECT ACCOUNTS?  

Managers’ business decisions often result in transactions that affect the financial statements. For example, decisions to expand the number of stores, advertise a new product, change an employee benefit package, and invest excess cash all would affect the financial statements. Sometimes these decisions have unintended consequences as well. The decision to purchase additional inventory for cash in anticipation of a major sales initiative, for example, will increase inventory and decrease cash. But if there is no demand for the additional inventory, the lower cash balance also will reduce the company’s ability to pay its other obligations.  

Because business decisions often involve an element of risk, managers should understand exactly how transactions impact the financial statements. The process for determining the effects of transactions is called transaction analysis.  

## Principles of Transaction Analysis  

Transaction analysis is the process of studying a transaction to determine its economic effect on the entity in terms of the accounting equation. We outline the process in this section of the chapter and create a visual tool representing the process (the transaction analysis model). The basic accounting equation and two principles are the foundation for this model. Recall from Chapter 1 that the basic accounting equation for a business that is organized as a corporation is as follows:  

## Assets $\mathbf{\Psi}(\mathbf{A})=$ Liabilities $(\mathbf{L})+$ Stockholders’ Equity (SE)  

The two principles underlying the transaction analysis process follow:  

•	 Every transaction affects at least two accounts; correctly identifying those accounts and the direction of the effects (whether an increase or a decrease) is critical. •	 The accounting equation must remain in balance after each transaction.  

Success in performing transaction analysis depends on a clear understanding of these principles.   
Study the following material well.  

## Dual Effects  

The idea that every transaction has at least two effects on the basic accounting equation is known as the dual effects concept. (From this concept, accountants have developed what is known as the double-entry system of recordkeeping.) Most transactions with external parties involve an exchange by which the business entity both receives something and gives up something in return.  

For example, suppose Chipotle purchased tomatoes (supplies) and paid cash. In this exchange, Chipotle would receive food supplies (an increase in an asset) and in return would give up cash (a decrease in an asset).  

![](images/c280ab165cc9a400f3bc8a577aa7ceea3d32c1b0ea4639966649cc4119335109.jpg)  

In analyzing this transaction, we determined that the accounts affected were Supplies and Cash. However, most supplies are purchased on credit (that is, money is owed to suppliers). In that case, Chipotle would engage in two separate transactions at different points in time:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>A =</td><td>L</td><td>+</td><td>SE</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>+/-</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

## Balancing the Accounting Equation  

Notice in the previous tomato purchase illustrations that the accounting equation for each transaction remained in balance. The accounting equation must remain in balance after each transaction. That is, total assets (resources) must equal total liabilities and stockholders’ equity (claims to resources). If all correct accounts have been identified and the appropriate direction of the effect on each account has been determined, the equation should remain in balance. Exhibit 2.3 lists the steps to follow in analyzing investing and financing transactions, with an example of applying the steps. Follow these steps in all illustrations and assignments in this chapter.  

## Analyzing Common Transactions  

To illustrate the use of the transaction analysis process, let’s consider hypothetical transactions of Chipotle that are also common to most businesses. Remember that this chapter presents investing and financing transactions that affect only the balance sheet accounts. “Investing” does not just mean buying other companies’ stocks and bonds. Investing activities by a company are those in which the company typically buys or sells its noncurrent assets (growing or shrinking its productive capacity) as well as investments (current or noncurrent). Financing activities are those in which the company borrows or repays loans (typically from banks) and sells or repurchases its common stock and pays dividends (activities with stockholders).

Assume that Chipotle engages in the following events during the first quarter of 2020, the first three months following the balance sheet in Exhibit 2.1. Account titles are from that balance sheet, and remember that, for simplicity, all amounts are in millions, except per share data:  

(a) Chipotle issued (sold) 100 additional shares of common stock with a par value of $\mathbb{S0.01}$ per share at a market value of $\mathbf{50.17}$ per share, receiving $\bf{517}$ in cash from investors—a financing activity. Each share of common stock usually has a nominal (low) par value printed on the face of the certificate. Par value is a legal amount per share established by the board of directors; it has no relationship to the market price of the stock (additional discussion in Chapter 11). Chipotle’s common stock has a par value of $\mathbb{S}0.01$ per share, and in this transaction, each share sold for $\mathbb{S}0.17$ per share. When a corporation issues common (capital) stock, the transaction affects separate accounts:  

•	 Received from shareholders: Cash or other considerations for the market value of the shares given (100 shares $\times\,\mathbb{S}0.17$ market value per share $=\mathbb{5}17_{.}$ ).  

•	 Given to shareholders: Common Stock for the number of shares issued times the par value per share $(100\ \mathrm{shares}\times\mathbb{9}0.01\$ par value per share $=\S1$ ) and Additional Paid-in Capital (or Paid-in Capital or Contributed Capital in Excess of Par) for the excess received above par $(100\ \mathrm{shares}\times\mathbb{9}0.16\$ per share in excess over par value per share [that is, $\mathbb{S}0.17$ market value per share − $\mathbb{S}0.01$ par value per share] $=\mathbb{S}16$ ).

Companies that need cash to buy or build additional facilities often seek funds by selling stock to investors as in transaction $(a)$ or by borrowing from creditors as in transaction $(b)$ . Any transactions with stockholders (usually issuing additional stock and paying dividends) and transactions with banks (borrowing and repaying loans) are financing activities.

Transaction analysis involves identifying accounts affected in a transaction (by title), recognizing that at least two accounts are affected, classifying the accounts (asset, liability, or stockholders’ equity), and determining the direction of the effect on the account (increase or decrease). If all accounts and effects are correct, then the fundamental accounting equation $\mathrm{{(A=L+SE)}}$ ) will remain in balance. Practice is the most effective way to develop your transaction analysis skills.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2-4  

Determine the impact of business transactions on the balance sheet using two basic tools: Journal entries and T-accounts.  

## HOW DO COMPANIES KEEP TRACK OF ACCOUNT BALANCES?  

For most organizations, recording transaction effects and keeping track of account balances in the manner just presented is impractical. To handle the multitude of daily transactions that a business generates, companies establish accounting systems, usually computerized, that follow a cycle. Exhibit 2.4 presents the primary activities of the accounting cycle performed during the accounting period separately from those that occur at the end of the accounting period. In Chapters 2 and 3, we will illustrate hypothetical transactions during Chipotle’s first quarter of 2020 (following steps 1–3 in Exhibit 2.4). In Chapter 4, we will complete the accounting cycle by discussing and illustrating activities at the end of the period to adjust the records, prepare financial statements, and finally close the accounting records.  

![](images/ea43da162cebc6cd9743144ecb5e0037e12037c7de0ae4be721d1060941f5590.jpg)  

## As future business  

managers, you should develop your understanding and use of these tools in financial analysis. For those studying accounting, this knowledge is the foundation for an understanding of the accounting system and future accounting coursework.  

During the accounting period, transactions that result in exchanges between the company and external parties are first analyzed to determine the accounts and effects. The effects are then recorded in the general journal, a listing in chronological order of each transaction’s effects. To determine account balances, the accounts are updated by posting the effects listed in the general journal to the respective accounts in the general ledger, a record of effects to and balances of each account.  

These formal records are based on two very important tools used by accountants: journal entries and T-accounts. From the standpoint of accounting systems design, these analytical tools are a more efficient way to reflect the effects of transactions, determine account balances, and prepare financial statements. After we explain how to perform transaction analysis using these tools, we illustrate their use in financial analysis.  

## The Direction of Transaction Effects  

As we saw earlier in this chapter, transaction effects increase and decrease assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity accounts. To reflect these effects efficiently, we need to structure the transaction analysis model in a manner that shows the direction of the effects. As shown in Exhibit 2.5, each account is set up as a “T” with the following structure:  

•	 Increases in asset accounts are on the left because assets are on the left side of the accounting equation $\mathbf{\mu}(\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{SE})$ ).   
•	 Increases in liability and stockholders’ equity accounts are on the right because they are on the right side of the accounting equation $\mathbf{\mu}(\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{SE})$ ).  

Also notice that  

•	 The term debit (dr for short) always refers to the left side of the T.   
•	 The term credit (cr for short) always refers to the right side of the T.  

## Start of the Next Accounting Period

Basic Transaction Analysis Model  

## EXHIBIT 2.5  

As a consequence:  

•	 Asset accounts increase on the left (debit) side and normally have debit balances. It would be highly unusual for an asset account, such as Inventory, to have a negative (credit) balance. •	 Liability and stockholders’ equity accounts increase on the right (credit) side and normally have credit balances.  

In summary:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td>Liabilities</td><td></td><td>Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td>with Debits</td><td rowspan="3"></td><td>with Credits</td><td></td><td>with Credits</td></tr><tr><td>Accountshave debitbalances</td><td>Accountshave creditbalances</td><td></td><td>Accountshave creditbalances</td></tr></table></body></html>  

In Chapter 3, we will add revenue and expense account effects to Retained Earnings in our model. Until then, as you are learning to perform transaction analysis, you should refer to the transaction analysis model in Exhibit 2.5 often until you can construct it on your own without assistance.  

Many students have trouble with accounting because they forget that the term debit is simply the left side of an account and the term credit is simply the right side of an account. Perhaps someone once told you that you were a credit to your school or your family. As a result, you may think that credits are good and debits are bad. Such is not the case. Just remember that debit is on the left and credit is on the right.  

If you have identified the correct accounts and effects through transaction analysis, the accounting equation will remain in balance. The total dollar value of all debits will equal the total dollar value of all credits in a transaction. For an extra measure of assurance, add this equality check (Debits $=$ Credits) to the transaction analysis process.  

From Exhibit 2.5, we learned that each account can increase and decrease. In the transaction analysis model, the effect of a transaction on each element can be represented with a T with one side increasing and the other side decreasing. Asset accounts on the left side of the accounting equation increase their balances on the left side of the T. Liability and stockholders’ equity accounts are on the right side of the  

## Reminder: Debit is  

on the left side and Credit is on the right side of a T-account. And that’s it!  

accounting equation and increase their balances on the right side of the T. In accounting, the left side of the T is called the debit side and the right is called the credit side. Most accounts have a balance on the positive side.  

## S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z  

The following is a list of accounts from a balance sheet of The Wendy’s Company. Indicate on the line provided whether each of the following usually has a debit (DR) or credit (CR) balance.

Tip When accountants look at a correct journal entry, they can tell you   
what the transaction was.   
You should be able to do   
this, too!  

## Analytical Tools  

## The Journal Entry  

In an accounting system, transactions are recorded in chronological order in a general journal (or, simply, journal). After analyzing the business documents (such as purchase invoices, receipts, and cash register tapes) that describe a transaction, the effects on the accounts are recorded in the journal using debits and credits. The journal entry, then, is an accounting method for expressing the effects of a transaction on accounts. It is written in a debits-equal-credits format. To illustrate, we refer back to event $(a)$ in Chipotle’s transaction analysis in the previous section.  

(a) Assume Chipotle issued (sold) 100 additional shares of common stock with a par value of $\mathbf{\hat{s0.01}}$ per share at a market value of $\mathbf{50.17}$ per share, receiving $\mathbf{517}$ in cash from investors.  

The journal entry for event $(a)$ in the Chipotle illustration is as follows:  

![](images/c9ecebf8470d28087989038a83547ff40b365c5a14aaacd7873bf1b3a853c2b6.jpg)  

Notice the following:  

![](images/e2d51e0150b97aae6c3d890b7f43d4558f5d51e748a0c7a6542c2fb43a20dbe0.jpg)  

The debited accounts (on top) represent what was received.  

The credited accounts (on bottom) represent what was given.  

•	 It is useful to include a date or some form of reference for each transaction. The debited accounts are written first (on top) with the amounts recorded in the left (debit) column. The credited accounts are written below the debits and are usually indented in manual records; the credited amounts are written in the right column. The order of the debited accounts or credited accounts does not matter, as long as the debits are on top and the credits are on the bottom and indented to the right.   
•	 Dollar signs are not needed.   
•	 Total debits $(\mathbb{S}17)$ equal total credits $(\mathbb{S}1+\mathbb{S}16=\mathbb{S}17)$ ).   
•	 Three accounts are affected by this transaction. Any journal entry that affects more than two accounts is called a compound entry. Many transactions in this and subsequent chapters require a compound journal entry.  

(a) CR; (b) CR; (c) CR; (d) DR; (e) DR; (f) DR; (g) DR; (h) CR; (i) DR •	 As you can see in the illustration of a formal bookkeeping system in Exhibit 2.6, an additional line is written below the journal entry as an explanation of the transaction. For simplicity, explanations will not be included in this text.  

While you are learning to perform transaction analysis, use the symbols A, L, and SE next to each account title in journal entries, as is illustrated in the journal entry for event $(a)$ . Specifically identifying an account as an asset (A), a liability (L), or a stockholders’ equity account (SE) clarifies the transaction analysis and makes journal entries easier to write. For example, if Cash is to be increased, we write Cash $(+\mathbf{A})$ . Throughout subsequent chapters, we include the direction of the effect along with the symbol to help you understand the effects of each transaction on the financial statements. By using the symbols in event $(a)$ , we can easily see that assets are affected by $+\mathbb{S}17$ and stockholders’ equity accounts are affected by $+\mathbb{S}17.$ The accounting equation $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{S}\mathbf{E}$ remains in balance.  

A note of caution: Many students try to memorize journal entries without understanding or using the transaction analysis model. As more detailed transactions are presented in subsequent chapters, the task becomes increasingly more difficult. In the long run, memorizing, understanding, and using the transaction analysis model presented here will save you time and prevent confusion.  

## The T-Account  

By themselves, journal entries do not provide the balances in accounts. After the journal entries have been recorded, the dollar amounts to each account affected by the transaction are posted (transferred) to determine the new account balances. (In most computerized accounting systems, this happens automatically.)  

As a group, the accounts are called a general ledger. In the manual accounting system used by some small businesses, the ledger is often a three-ring binder with a separate page for each account. In a computerized system, accounts are stored on the computer’s memory or in the cloud. See Exhibit 2.6 for an illustration of a journal page and the related ledger pages. Note

## Tip  

Memorize and use the transaction analysis model for all transactions.  

## EXHIBIT 2.6  

Posting Transaction Effects from the Journal to the Ledger  

that the debit amount of $\mathbb{S}17$ to Cash from the journal entry for event $\overline{{(a)}}$ has been posted to the debit column on the Cash ledger page. Likewise, the credit amounts of $\mathbb{S}1$ and $\mathbb{S}16$ in the journal entry have been posted to the credit columns on the respective Common Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital ledger pages. Again, dollar signs are not needed.  

One very useful tool for summarizing the transaction effects and determining the balances for individual accounts is a T-account, a simplified representation of a ledger account. Exhibit 2.7 shows the T-accounts for Chipotle’s Cash and Common Stock accounts based on event $(a)$ (the same would also be done for the Additional Paid-in Capital T-account). Notice the following:  

•	 For Cash, which is classified as an asset, increases are shown on the left and decreases appear on the right side of the T-account. For Common Stock, however, increases are shown on the right and decreases on the left because Common Stock is a stockholders equity account.   
•	 Every T-account starts with a beginning balance.   
•	 It is important to include the reference to the journal entry next to the debit or credit in each T-account. In our illustration, it is (a). For companies, it would be a date. This cross-referencing allows the transactions to be traced between the journal entries and T-accounts.   
•	 When all of the transactions have been posted to a T-account, a horizontal line is drawn across it, similar to the line that is drawn in a mathematical problem, to signify that a balance is to be determined.   
•	 An ending balance is written on the appropriate side of the T-account.  

Some small businesses still use handwritten or manually maintained accounts in this T-account format. Computerized systems retain the concept but not the format of the T-account (that is, a positive number is written on the positive side of the T-account).  

To find the account balances, we can express the T-accounts as equations:  

![](images/ae849087dfd6214f2a81b295bb1b11fa2ed9968e713947d220a2e337a2428731.jpg)  

A word on terminology: The words debit and credit may be used as verbs, nouns, and adjectives. For example, we can say that Chipotle’s Cash account was debited (verb) when stock was issued to investors, meaning that the amount was entered on the left side of the T-account. Or we can say that a credit (noun) was entered on the right side of an account. Common Stock may be described as a credit account (adjective). These terms will be used instead of left and right throughout the rest of this textbook. The next section illustrates the steps to follow in analyzing the effects of transactions, recording the effects in journal entries, and determining account balances using T-accounts.

## Inferring Business Activities from T-Accounts  

T-accounts are useful primarily for instructional and analytical purposes. In many cases, we will use T-accounts to determine what transactions a company engaged in during a period. For example, the primary transactions affecting Accounts Payable for a period are purchases of assets on account from suppliers (increasing the account) and cash payments to suppliers (decreasing the account). If we know the beginning and ending balances of Accounts Payable and the amount of purchases on account (for credit) during a period, we can determine the amount of cash paid. A T-account analysis would include the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">-Accounts Payable (L)+ 600</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Cashpayments tosuppliers? 1,500</td><td colspan="2">Beg. bal. Purchases on account</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">300</td><td></td><td>End. bal.</td></tr><tr><td>Solution: Beginning Balance</td><td>+</td><td>Purchaseson Account</td><td>Cash Payments to Suppliers</td><td>Ending Balance</td></tr><tr><td>$600</td><td>+</td><td>$1,500</td><td>? ？ 二</td><td>$ 300 $1,800</td></tr></table></body></html>  

## Transaction Analysis Illustrated  

In this section, we will use the hypothetical quarterly investing and financing transactions for Chipotle Mexican Grill (events $[a]$ to $[h]_{.}$ ) that were analyzed earlier to demonstrate recording journal entries and posting effects to the relevant T-accounts. Note that the accounting equation remains in balance and that debits equal credits after each entry. In the T-accounts, the amounts from Chipotle’s December 31, 2019, balance sheet (Exhibit 2.1) have been inserted as the beginning balances.  

Study the following illustration carefully, including the explanations of transaction analysis. Careful study is essential to an understanding of (1) the accounting model, (2) transaction analysis, (3) the dual effects of each transaction, and (4) the system of balancing the debits and credits and the accounting equation for each transaction. The most effective way to learn these critical concepts, which are basic to material throughout the rest of the text, is to practice, practice, practice.  

(a) Assume Chipotle issued (sold) 100 additional shares of common stock with a par value of $\mathbf{\hat{s0.01}}$ per share at a market value of $\mathbf{50.17}$ per share, receiving $\mathbf{517}$ in cash from investors—an financing activity. Common stock is recorded at par $(100\;\mathrm{shares}\times\mathbb{9}0.01\$ par value per share) and Additional Paid-in Capital is recorded for the excess over par value (100 shares × $\mathcal{S}0.16$ per share).

The effects reflected in the journal entry have been posted to the appropriate T-accounts. Notice that if an account was debited such as Cash, that effect was written in the debit column of the Cash T-account. Similarly, if an account was credited such as Common Stock, that effect was written in the credit column of the T-account. Also notice that the January 1, 2020, beginning balances are the same as the ending balances at December 31, 2019 (see Exhibit 2.1), and are indicated on the respective positive side of the account—assets have debit balances and liabilities and stockholders’ equity accounts have credit balances.  

(b) Chipotle borrowed $\pmb{\mathbb{S4}}$ from its local bank, signing a note to be paid in three years (a noncurrent liability)—a financing activity.

(d) Chipotle acquired $\mathbf{520}$ in additional land and $\mathbb{S40}$ in new buildings, signed leases for $\mathbb{S86}$ for right-of-use (ROU) assets, paid $\mathbf{529}$ in cash, and signed $\mathfrak{s}6$ in current leases and $\mathbf{\hat{s}111}$ in long-term leases to rent facilities—a financing activity.

(f) Within the quarter, assume Chipotle paid $\mathbf{s1}$ on the note payable in $\mathbf{\mu}(b)$ above (ignore any interest on the loan in this chapter)—a financing activity.

(g) Chipotle repurchased a portion of its issued common stock from investors for $\mathbf{5103}$ cash—a financing activity. When a company buys back its stock, it is accounted for in a new type of account called a contra-account. A contra-account reduces an account or section of a financial statement it is related to. In this case, the account is called Treasury Stock and it reduces total stockholders’ equity. Treasury Stock accounting and reporting are discussed in more depth in Chapter 11.

Tip Reminder: Debiting Treasury Stock increases the account,   
but it has a negative effect on   
stockholders’ equity.

(h) Chipotle does not pay dividends, but instead reinvests profits into growing the business. However, for illustration purposes, assume Chipotle’s board of directors declared that the Company will pay a total of $\pmb{\mathbb{s}}2$ in cash as dividends to shareholders next quarter. Dividends are a distribution of profits (from Retained Earnings) to shareholders. When cash dividends are declared, a liability is created until the cash is distributed to shareholders. Because Dividends Payable was not listed on the December 31, 2019, balance sheet (see Exhibit 2.1), it has a $\mathbb{S}0$ balance on January 1, 2020.

Now we can determine the balances in the T-accounts that changed during the quarter based on the hypothetical transactions. As shown in Exhibit 2.8, each T-account is listed with the beginning balances and transaction effects with references. Then a line is drawn across the T-account after the last transaction effect with the balance indicated below the summation line on the positive side.

Accountants analyze and then record transactions in the general journal in chronological order in journal entry form. Debited accounts are written on top with amounts in the left column and credited accounts are written on the bottom with amounts in the right column. Then the effects are posted in the general ledger (similar to a T-account). Each page of the ledger represents a different account that has a debit (left) side and a credit (right) side. To post transaction effects, the amount for each account in a journal entry is written in the appropriate debit or credit column on the ledger page to obtain account balances. Refer to Exhibit 2.5 for the transaction analysis model.

## Using Data Analytics for Business Expansion  

Data Analytics (also called Business Intelligence and Big Data) has exploded in the past several years, but what is it? SAS (a world leader in business analytics software and services) describes it as follows:  

Big data analytics examines large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other insights. With today’s technology, it’s possible to analyze your data and get answers from it almost immediately. . . .2  

By collecting structured data from various sources inside the business (from accounting, human resources, supply chain, and sales) and unstructured data from outside the business (from social media, customers, and weather and traffic patterns), companies worldwide are now making more data-driven business decisions. These decisions can be aimed at decreasing costs, identifying new innovative opportunities, launching new products and services, and transforming the business for the future.  

Beginning in 2017, Chipotle increased its investment in technological innovations, such as digital/ mobile ordering, which provides more information about its customers. Chipotle also uses data analytics for new restaurant site selection. The company gathers demographic and business information about each area, as well as information on competitors and other restaurants, and uses a predictive model to project sales and return on investment for each potential restaurant site. Chipotle, like most companies, understands the importance of creating a data-driven culture to change the way it thinks.  

What does this shift to a data-driven culture mean for students? Competition for talented individuals with strong analytical skills is extreme. Zoher Karu, vice president, global customer optimization and data at eBay, stated it this way:  

Talent is critical along any data and analytics journey. And analytics talent by itself is no longer sufficient, in my opinion. We cannot have people with singular skills. And the way I build out my organization is I look for people with a major and a minor. You can major in analytics, but you can minor in marketing strategy. Because if you don’t have a minor, how are you going to communicate with other parts of the organization? Otherwise, the pure data scientist will not be able to talk to the database administrator, who will not be able to talk to the market-research person, who which [sic] will not be able to talk to the email-channel owner, for example. You need to make sound business decisions, based on analytics, that can scale.3  

## HOW IS THE BALANCE SHEET PREPARED AND ANALYZED?  

Although no operating activities occurred yet (they will be illustrated in Chapter 3), it is possible to create a balance sheet based solely on the investing and financing activities recorded previously. Usually, businesses first will create a trial balance spreadsheet for internal purposes before preparing statements for external users. A trial balance lists the names of the T-accounts in one column, usually in financial statement order (assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues, and expenses), with their ending debit or credit balances in the next two columns. Debit balances are indicated in the left column and credit balances are indicated in the right column. Then the two columns are totaled to provide a check on the equality of the debits and credits. Errors in a computer-generated trial balance may exist if wrong accounts and/or amounts are used in the journal entries.

heading (name of the company, title of the statement, date, and if the dollars are in thousands or millions). Notice in Exhibit 2.9 several additional features:  

•	 The assets and liabilities are classified into two categories: current and noncurrent. Current assets are those to be used or turned into cash within the upcoming year, whereas noncurrent assets are those that will last longer than one year. Current liabilities are those obligations to be paid or settled within the next 12 months with current assets.   
•	 Dollar signs are indicated at the top and bottom of the asset section and top and bottom of the liabilities and shareholders’ equity section. More than that tends to look messy.   
•	 The statement includes comparative data. That is, it compares the actual but simplified account balances at December 31, 2019, with those at March 31, 2020, based on assumed quarterly transactions. When multiple periods are presented, the most recent balance sheet amounts are usually listed on the left, but not always (look carefully).   
•	 Unlike Chipotle, most companies do not provide a total liabilities line on the balance sheet. To determine total liabilities on those statements, add total current liabilities and  

each of the noncurrent liabilities.  

## INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE  

## Understanding Foreign Financial Statements  

Although IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) differ from U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), it uses the same system of analyzing, recording, and summarizing the results of business activities that you have learned in this chapter. One place where IFRS differs from GAAP is in the formatting of financial statements.  

Financial statements prepared using GAAP and IFRS include the same elements (assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, etc.). However, a single, consistent format has not been mandated. Consequently, various formats have evolved over time, with those in the United States differing from those typically used internationally. The formatting differences include  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">GAAP IFRS</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">BalanceSheetOrder Similaraccountsare shown,buttheorderof liquidity(for assets)and theorderofmaturity(for liabilities)differ</td><td>Assets: Stockholders'Equity</td><td>Assets:</td></tr><tr><td>Current Noncurrent Liabilities: Stockholders'Equity Current Liabilities: Noncurrent Current</td><td>Noncurrent Current Noncurrent</td></tr></table></body></html>  

On the balance sheet, GAAP begins with current items, whereas IFRS begins with noncurrent items.  Consistent  with  this, assets  are  listed  in  decreasing  order  of  liquidity  under  GAAP,  but, internationally, assets are usually listed in increasing order of liquidity. IFRS similarly emphasizes longerterm financing sources by listing equity before liabilities and, within liabilities, by listing noncurrent liabilities before current liabilities (decreasing time to maturity). The key to avoiding confusion is to be sure to pay attention to the subheadings in the statement. Any account under the heading “liabilities” must be a liability.  

## Ratio Analysis in Decision Making  

Why do the classifications of current and noncurrent on the balance sheet matter? Users of financial information compute a number of ratios in analyzing a company’s past performance and financial condition as input in predicting its future potential. How ratios change over time and how they compare to the ratios of the company’s competitors or industry averages provide valuable information about a company’s strategies for its operating, investing, and financing activities. We introduce here the first of many ratios that will be presented throughout the rest of this textbook, with a final summary of ratio analysis in Chapter 13.

INTERPRETATIONS  

## In General  

The current ratio is a very common ratio. Creditors and security analysts use the current ratio to measure the ability of the company to pay its short-term obligations with short-term assets. Generally, the higher the ratio, the more cushion a company has to pay its current obligations if future economic conditions take a downturn. Many industries, such as retail companies and manufacturers, historically face difficult times with sustained dips in the economy. They often have a current ratio at 2.0 (twice as many current economic resources as current obligations) or higher to be able to pay employees, suppliers, and other current obligations until the economy recovers.  

While a ratio above 1.0 normally suggests good liquidity, today, many strong companies use sophisticated management techniques to minimize funds invested in current assets and, as a result, have current ratios below 1.0. Many businesses with strong inflows of cash from customers, like Chipotle and its competitors, also may have a current ratio below 1.0. Likewise, when compared to others in the industry, too high of a ratio may suggest inefficient use of resources.  

## Focus Company Analysis  

Over time, the current ratio for Chipotle shows a high level of liquidity of 1.609, although the ratio has decreased each year since 2017. In 2019, nearly half of its current assets was in cash, which the company uses to fund its rapid growth strategy of opening or renovating over 130 new restaurants annually, many with Chipotlanes for drive-through service.  

Compared with competitors in the fast-casual restaurant industry, Chipotle reports a much higher current ratio than Shake Shack and El Pollo Loco. Shake Shack operates over 275 restaurants worldwide, all company owned. Its strategy is to open a significant portion of new stores in airports. The approximately 480 El Pollo Loco restaurants are located primarily in the southwest United States and are approximately 40 percent company-owned and 60 percent franchised. El Pollo Loco’s plans are to grow its loyalty program and expand franchising opportunities. Franchising does not typically require the higher cash flow levels needed for expanding company-owned facilities. Companies in the restaurant industry tend to have high cash inflows from customers as well as sophisticated cash management systems that enable them to maintain lower cash balances, and thus lower current ratios.  

## A Few Cautions  

The current ratio may be a misleading measure of liquidity if significant funds are tied up in assets that cannot be easily converted into cash. A company with a high current ratio still might have liquidity problems if the majority of its current assets consists of slow-moving inventory. Analysts also recognize that managers can manipulate the current ratio by engaging in certain transactions just before the close of the fiscal year. In most cases, for example, the current ratio can be improved by paying creditors immediately prior to the preparation of financial statements.

## P A U S E F O R F E E D B A C K  

We just learned that the current ratio measures a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations with short-term assets—a liquidity measure. It is computed by dividing current assets by current liabilities. A ratio above 1.0 is normally considered good, although some may need a higher ratio and others with good cash management systems and/or strong cash flows can have a ratio below 1.0 (i.e., more current liabilities than current assets).

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2-6  

Identify investing and financing transactions and demonstrate how they impact cash flows.  

## Investing and Financing Activities  

As discussed in Chapter 1, companies report cash inflows and outflows over a period in their statement of cash flows, which is divided into three categories: operating, investing, and financing activities:  

•	 Operating activities are covered in Chapter 3.   
•	 Investing activities include buying and selling noncurrent assets and short- and long-term investments. Financing activities include borrowing and repaying debt, including short-term bank loans; issuing and repurchasing stock; and paying dividends.  

You must see CASH in the transaction for it to affect the statement of cash flows.  

Only transactions affecting cash are reported on the statement. An important step in constructing and analyzing the statement of cash flows is identifying the various transactions as operating (O), investing (I), or financing (F). Let’s analyze the Cash T-account for Chipotle’s transactions in this chapter. Refer to transactions (a)–(h) illustrated earlier in this chapter.  

![](images/beffb5075f1321eba9503918dbac685df3290551b07c24eb0d102b478c3f6a3d.jpg)  

## P A U S E  F O R  F E E D B A C K  

As we discussed, every transaction affecting cash can be classified as an operating (discussed in Chapter 3), investing, or financing effect. Investing effects relate to purchasing/selling investments or noncurrent assets such as property and equipment or lending funds to/receiving repayment from others. Financing effects relate to borrowing or repaying banks, issuing stock to investors, repurchasing stock from investors, or paying dividends to investors.  

## S E L F - S T U D Y  Q U I Z  

Indicate whether the following transactions from a recent annual statement of cash flows for Apple Inc. were investing (I) or financing (F) activities and the direction of their effects on cash $^+$ for increases; − for decreases):

Current Ratio: 2019 \$1,527 ÷ \$1,541 = 0.991 2018 1,207 ÷ 1,301 = 0.928 2017 2,507 ÷ 1,512 = 1.658  

Yum! Brands’ most recent current ratio hovers near 1.0, although it has fluctuated over the past three years. The 0.991 ratio suggests that the company currently has sufficient current assets to settle short-term obligations. There is no concern about liquidity because Yum! Brands is a cash-oriented business and maintains a strong cash management system.

2-1.	 Define the key accounting assumptions, principles, and elements related to the balance sheet. p. 47 Assumptions:  

Separate entity assumption—Transactions of the business are accounted for separately from transactions of the owner.   
Going concern assumption—A business is expected to continue to operate into the foreseeable future. Monetary unit assumption—Financial information is reported in the national monetary unit with out adjustment for changes in purchasing power.  

## Principles:  

Historical cost principle—Financial statement elements should be recorded at the cash-equivalent cost on the date of the transaction; however, these values may be adjusted to other amounts, such as market value, depending on certain conditions.  

Elements of the balance sheet:  

Assets—Economic resources owned or controlled by a company; they have measurable value and are expected to benefit the company by producing cash inflows or reducing cash outflows in the future. Liabilities—Measurable obligations resulting from a past transaction; they are expected to be settled in the future by transferring assets or providing services. Stockholders’ equity—Residual interest of owners in the assets of the entity after settling liabilities; the financing provided by the owners (contributed capital) and by business operations (earned capital).  

2-2.	 Identify what constitutes a business transaction and recognize common balance sheet account titles used in business. p. 50  

•	 An exchange of cash, goods, or services for cash, goods, services, or promises between a business and one or more external parties to a business (not the exchange of a promise for a promise), or  

•	 A measurable internal event, such as adjustments for the use of assets in operations.  

An account is a standardized format that organizations use to accumulate the dollar effects of transactions related to each financial statement item. Typical balance sheet account titles include the following:  

•	 Assets: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Investments, Property (buildings and land) and Equipment, and Intangibles (rights without physical substance).   
•	 Liabilities: Accounts Payable, Notes Payable, Accrued Expenses Payable, Unearned Revenues, and Taxes Payable.   
•	 Stockholders’ Equity: Common Stock, Additional Paid-in Capital, and Retained Earnings.  

2-3.	 Apply transaction analysis to simple business transactions in terms of the accounting model: Assets = Liabilities $^+$ Stockholders’ Equity. p. 52  

To determine the economic effect of a transaction on an entity in terms of the accounting equation, each transaction must be analyzed to determine the accounts (at least two) that are affected. In an exchange, the company receives something and gives up something. If the accounts, direction of the effects, and amounts are correctly analyzed, the accounting equation will stay in balance.  

Systematic transaction analysis includes (1) determining the accounts that were received and were given in the exchange, including the type of each account (A, L, or SE), the amounts, and the direction of the effects, and (2) determining that the accounting equation remains in balance.  

2-4.	 Determine the impact of business transactions on the balance sheet using two basic tools: journal entries and T-accounts. p. 58  

•	 Journal entries express the effects of a transaction on accounts in a debits-equal-credits format. The accounts and amounts to be debited are listed first. Then the accounts and amounts to be credited are listed below the debits and indented, resulting in debit amounts on the left and credit amounts on the right. Each entry needs a reference (date, number, or letter).   
•	 T-accounts summarize the transaction effects for each account. These tools can be used to determine balances and draw inferences about a company’s activities.  

2-5.	 Prepare a trial balance and simple classified balance sheet and analyze the company using the current ratio. p. 68  

A trial balance lists all accounts and their balances, with debit balances in the left column and credit balances in the right column. The two columns are totaled to determine if debits equal credits.  

Classified balance sheets are structured as follows:  

•	 Assets are categorized as current assets (those to be used or turned into cash within the year, with inventory always considered a current asset) and noncurrent assets, such as long-term investments, property and equipment, and intangible assets.   
Liabilities are categorized as current liabilities (those that will be paid with current assets) and long-term liabilities.   
Stockholders’ equity accounts are listed as Common Stock (number of shares $\times$ par value per share) and Additional Paid-in Capital (number of shares $\times$ excess of issue price over par value per share) first, followed by Retained Earnings (earnings reinvested in the business).  

The current ratio (Current Assets $\div$ Current Liabilities) measures a company’s liquidity, that is, the ability of the company to pay its short-term obligations with current assets.  

2-6.	 Identify investing and financing transactions and demonstrate how they impact cash flows. p. 74  

A statement of cash flows reports the sources and uses of cash for the period by the type of activity that generated the cash flow: operating, investing, and financing. Investing activities include purchas ing and selling investments and long-term assets, and making loans and receiving principal repay ments from others. Financing activities include borrowing from and repaying to banks the principal amount on loans, issuing and repurchasing stock, and paying dividends.  

In this chapter, we discussed the accounting model and transaction analysis. Journal entries and T-accounts were used to record the results of transaction analysis for investing and financing decisions that affect balance sheet accounts. In Chapter 3, we continue our detailed look at the financial statements, in particular the income statement. The purpose of Chapter 3 is to build on your knowledge by discussing the measurement of revenues and expenses and illustrating the transaction analysis of operating decisions.  

Current ratio measures the ability of the company to pay its short-term obligations with current assets. Although a ratio above 1.0 indicates sufficient current assets to meet obligations when they come due, many companies with sophisticated cash management systems have ratios below 1.0 (see Key Ratio Analysis on p. 72.)

## Critical Thinking Cases  

## Making a Decision as a Financial Analyst: Preparing and Analyzing a Balance Sheet  

Your best friend from home writes you a letter about an investment opportunity that has come her way. A company is raising money by issuing shares of stock and wants her to invest $\mathbb{S}20{,}000$ (her recent inheritance from her great-aunt’s estate). Your friend has never invested in a company before and, knowing that you are a financial analyst, asks that you look over the balance sheet and send her some advice. An unaudited balance sheet, in only moderately good form, is enclosed with the letter.  

There is only one disclosure note, and it states that the building was purchased for $\mathbb{S}65{,}000$ , has been depreciated by $\mathbb{S}5{,}000$ on the books, and still carries a mortgage (shown in the liability section). The note also states that, in the opinion of the company president, the building is “easily worth $^{\S98,000.}$ .”

Required:  

1.	 Draft a new balance sheet for your friend, correcting any errors you note. (If any of the account balances need to be corrected, you may need to adjust the retained earnings balance correspondingly.) If there are no errors or omissions, so state. 2.	 Write a letter to your friend explaining the changes you made to the balance sheet, if any, and offer your comments on the company’s apparent financial condition based only on this information. Suggest other information your friend might want to review before coming to a final decision on whether to invest.  

## Evaluating an Ethical Dilemma: Analyzing Management Incentives  

On December 5, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged two top executives of Celadon Group, Inc., an Indiana-based trucking company, for their participation in an accounting fraud. The SEC alleged that “they sought to conceal losses by engaging in a scheme to buy and sell trucks at inflated prices, in some cases double or triple their fair market value . . . As alleged in our complaint, these members of Celadon’s C-suite lied to its auditor and investors to try to conceal millions of dollars of overvalued trucks,” said Joel R. Levin, Director of the SEC’s Chicago Regional Office. “The SEC will continue to pursue corporate officers who employ schemes to inflate financial statements and defraud investors.” (Source: sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-253)  

Epilogue: On December 9, 2019, Celadon Group, Inc., filed for bankruptcy and in March 2020, it auctioned off assets as part of the bankruptcy agreement.  

## Required:
