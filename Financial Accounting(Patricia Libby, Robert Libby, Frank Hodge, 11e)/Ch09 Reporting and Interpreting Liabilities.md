# Ch09 Reporting and Interpreting Liabilities

Scompany has approximately 350,000 employees working in over 32,000 stores enues of $\Phi23.5$ billion.  

Starbucks has ambitious growth plans for the future, intending to grow to 55,000 stores by 2030. To be successful, management must focus on a number of critical financing activities. These activities will generate funds to finance the current operating activities of the business and the long-term assets that will permit the company to grow in the future.  

## UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS  

Businesses finance the acquisition of assets from two external sources: funds supplied by creditors (debt) and funds provided by owners (equity). The mixture of debt and equity a business uses is called its capital structure. In addition to selecting a capital structure, management can select from a variety of sources from which to borrow money, as illustrated by the liability section of the balance sheet from Starbucks shown in Exhibit 9.1. What factors do managers consider when they borrow money? Two key factors are risk and cost. Debt capital is risky because payments associated with debt are a company’s legal obligation. If a company cannot meet a required debt payment (either principal or interest) because of a temporary cash shortage, creditors may force the company into bankruptcy and require the sale of assets to satisfy the debt. Due to the risks associated with debt financing, managers devote considerable time and effort analyzing alternative borrowing arrangements.

Companies that include debt in their capital structure also must make strategic decisions concerning the balance between short-term and long-term debt. To evaluate a company’s capital structure, financial analysts calculate a number of accounting ratios. In this chapter, we will discuss both short-term and long-term debt, as well as some important accounting ratios. We also will introduce present values and discuss the role present values play in how long-term liabilities are reported on a company’s balance sheet. In Chapter 10, we discuss a special category of long-term debt, bond securities. We conclude our discussion of a firm’s capital structure by examining stockholders’ equity in Chapter 11.

Define, measure, and report current liabilities.  

## LIABILITIES DEFINED AND CLASSIFIED  

Most people have a reasonable understanding of the definition of the word liability. Accountants formally define liabilities as the probable future sacrifice of economic benefits that arise from past transactions. As Exhibit 9.1 shows, as of September 27, 2020 (Starbucks’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30), Starbucks had borrowed $\mathbb{5}15{,}909{.}5$ million, the sum of the “current portion of long-term debt” $(\Phi1,249.9)$ and “long-term debt” $(\Phi14,659.6)$ These past transactions obligate the company to pay cash to its creditors at some time in the future, and therefore are reported as liabilities on the balance sheet.  

When a liability is first recorded, it is measured in terms of its current cash equivalent, which is the cash amount a creditor would accept to settle the liability immediately. Although Starbucks borrowed $\mathbb{5}15{,}909{.}5$ million, it will repay much more than that because the company also must pay interest on the debt. Interest that will be paid in the future is not included in the reported amount of the liability because it accrues and becomes a liability with the passage of time.  

Like most businesses, Starbucks has several kinds of liabilities as well as a wide range of creditors. The list of liabilities on the balance sheet differs from one company to the next because different operating activities result in different types of liabilities. The liability section of Starbucks’s balance sheet begins with the caption Current liabilities. Current liabilities are expected to be paid with current assets within the current operating cycle of the business or within one year of the balance sheet date, whichever is longer. Noncurrent liabilities include all other liabilities.  

## CURRENT LIABILITIES  

Many current liabilities have a direct relationship to the operating activities of a business. In other words, specific operating activities are financed, in part, by a related current liability. Some examples from Starbucks’s balance sheet (Exhibit 9.1) are  

![](images/9dada9bf8573391ed689707c4098a32dcb2789b1016604dfc31e5d7074dbfa47.jpg)  

Early in this chapter, we mentioned that Starbucks is opening a lot of new stores each year. As a result, it must buy additional inventory, rent more store space, and hire more employees. By understanding the relationship between operating activities and current liabilities, an analyst can explain changes in the various current liability accounts.  

We now will discuss the current liability accounts that are common to most balance sheets.  

## Accounts Payable  

Most companies in the course of running their day-to-day operations purchase goods and services from other businesses. Typically, these purchases are made on credit with cash payments made after the goods and services have been provided. As a result, these transactions create obligations to pay suppliers in the near future. Most companies list such obligations on their balance sheets as accounts payable (sometimes called trade accounts payable).  

For many companies, buying on credit from suppliers is a relatively inexpensive way to finance the purchase of inventory because interest does not normally accrue on accounts payable. As an incentive to encourage more sales, some suppliers offer generous credit terms that may allow buyers to resell merchandise and collect cash before payment must be made to the supplier.  

Some managers may be tempted to delay payment to suppliers as long as possible to conserve cash. This strategy can create problems for suppliers, who also must pay their bills. Most successful companies develop positive working relationships with suppliers to facilitate receiving quality goods and services. A positive relationship can be destroyed by slow payments. In addition, financial analysts become concerned if a business does not meet its obligations to suppliers on a timely basis because such slowness can indicate that a company is experiencing financial difficulties. Both managers and analysts use the accounts payable turnover ratio to evaluate how effectively a company is managing its accounts payable.

## INTERPRETATIONS  

In General The accounts payable turnover ratio measures how quickly management pays suppliers. A high accounts payable ratio normally suggests that a company is paying its suppliers in a timely manner. To make interpreting the ratio more intuitive, analysts often divide it into the number of days in a year:  

In 2020 the average number of days it took Starbucks to pay its accounts payable was  

$$
365~\mathrm{Days}\div7.04=51.85~\mathrm{Days}
$$  

This means that, on average, Starbucks took between 51 and 52 days to pay its suppliers in 2020.  

Focus Company Analysis Analyzing the average number of days payables are outstanding indicates that in 2020, Starbucks paid its suppliers more slowly than in 2018 (51.85 days versus 45.12 days), Relative to its competitors, Starbucks paid its suppliers more quickly than Monster Beverages but more slowly than McDonald’s. On average, Monster Beverages took 55.56 days to pay its suppliers and McDonald’s took 45.23 days. Suppliers like being paid as soon as possible and may extend benefits (e.g., faster shipments or preferential treatment when supply is limited) to companies that pay quickly.  

A Few Cautions The accounts payable turnover ratio is an average based on all accounts payable. As such, the ratio does not tell us how quickly a company is paying each of its suppliers. It is possible for a company to pay some suppliers quickly and others late and yet still end up with an acceptable ratio. This is not meant to suggest that the ratio is not useful. It simply implies that the more you know about the numbers used to calculate a ratio, the more fully you can understand the ratio’s implications.  

## Accrued Liabilities  

In many situations, a business incurs an expense in one accounting period and makes the cash payment in a future period. Accrued liabilities are expenses that have been incurred before the end of an accounting period but have not yet been paid. These expenses include items such as insurance, rent and wages. The fiscal 2020 balance sheet for Starbucks lists accrued liabilities of $^{\S1,160.7}$ million. Accrued liabilities are recorded by recognizing an expense for the period and an associated liability. For example, when a company records wages expense for a period but does not immediately pay the expense, it will record an accrued wages or payroll liability on its balance sheet.  

## Accrued Taxes Payable  

Like individuals, corporations must pay federal taxes on the income they earn. Corporations also may pay state and local income taxes and, in some cases, foreign income taxes. The notes to Starbucks’s Annual Report include the following information pertaining to taxes:

For Starbucks and most other corporations, income taxes represent a major cost and are therefore carefully monitored by management and various taxing authorities (e.g., the Internal Revenue Service).  

## Accrued Compensation and Related Costs  

At the end of each accounting period, employees usually have earned salaries that have not yet been paid. Unpaid salaries may be reported as part of a general accrued liability account on the balance sheet or as a separate item, as is the case with Starbucks. As shown in Exhibit 9.1, Starbucks reports “accrued payroll and benefits” of $\mathbb{S}696.0$ million. Benefits refer to items such as retirement programs, vacation time, and health insurance that employees have earned during the reporting period but have not taken or been paid.  

Let’s take a closer look at vacation time as an example. Typically, a business grants employees paid vacation time based on the number of months they have worked. The cost of vacation time must be recorded in the year employees earn the vacation time by working rather than the year they actually take vacation. If Starbucks estimates the cost of earned vacation time to be $\mathbb{s}125{,}000$ , accountants make the following adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period.  

![](images/2e8c7f6d049e6f801771467ce87ea0d226b9dbb52c97c502fdd771675f568a3f.jpg)  

When employees take vacations (for example, next summer), the accountants record the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Accrued vacation liability (-L)</td><td>125,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>125,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Assets Liabilities + Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Cash −125,000 Accrued vacation liability −125,000  

Starbucks does not separately disclose the amount of accrued vacation liability. Instead, the company reports this liability as part of “accrued payroll and benefits.” For most companies, the amount of accrued vacation liability is not large enough to warrant its own line item on the balance sheet.  

## Payroll Taxes  

All payrolls are subject to a variety of taxes, including federal, state, and local income taxes; Social Security taxes; and federal and state unemployment taxes. Employees pay some of these taxes and employers pay others. While we will look at only the three largest taxes, reporting is similar for other types of payroll tax.  

![](images/02d51a096aec216af000329d9c445fe0a76e108d93d4c89eb553e418402470d7.jpg)  

Employee Income Taxes Employers are required to withhold income taxes for each employee. The amount of income tax withheld is recorded by the employer as a current liability and remains a liability until the amount is paid to the government (usually quarterly).  

Employee and Employer FICA Taxes Social Security taxes often are called FICA taxes because they are required by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. These taxes are imposed in equal amounts on both employees and employers. Though employers only pay their portion of the taxes, they withhold the employees’ portion from their paychecks as part of an employee’s payroll deductions. The current Social Security tax rate is 6.2 percent for employees and 6.2 percent for employers, so 12.4 percent total. The Social Security tax is capped, meaning that the tax only applies to wages up to a certain amount. The capped amount for 2021 is $^{\S142,800}$ per employee. In addition, a separate 1.45 percent Medicare tax applies to all employee income. Therefore, the FICA tax rate is 7.65 percent (6.2 percent $+~1.45$ percent) on income up to and including $^{\S142,800}$ and 1.45 percent on income above $^{\S142,800}$ . Employees who earn above $\mathbb{S}200{,}000$ have withheld an “additional Medicare tax” of 0.9 percent. Unlike all other FICA taxes, this additional Medicare tax is paid only by employees, not by employers. However, employers also will withhold this additional tax as part of an employee’s payroll deductions.  

Employer Unemployment Taxes Employers are charged unemployment taxes through the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). These programs provide financial support to employees who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The FUTA tax rate is 6.0  percent. The tax applies to the first $\mathbb{S}7{,}000$ paid to each employee as wages during the year. SUTA tax rates vary by state.  

Hopefully by now you have realized that the cost of hiring employees is much more than the amount that those employees actually receive in wages. To illustrate recording payroll taxes, let’s assume that Starbucks accumulated the following information in its records for the first two weeks of June 2021:  

Salaries earned \$1,800,000   
Income taxes withheld 275,000   
FICA taxes (employees’ share) 137,700   
FUTA taxes 2,300   
SUTA taxes 8,500  

Companies generally record two journal entries to account for payroll taxes. The first entry records the amount of cash paid to employees and the various deductions withheld from employees’ paychecks:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Compensation expense (+E,-SE)</td><td>1,800,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Employee income taxes withheld (+L)</td><td>275,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">FICApayable(+L)</td><td></td><td>137,700</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>1,387,300</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"></td></tr><tr><td>Assets Cash -1,387,300</td><td>Liabilities FICA payable +137,700 Employeeincome taxeswithheld +275.000</td><td colspan="2">Stockholders'Equity + Compensation expense (+E) -1,800,000</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The second entry records the taxes that employers must pay from their own funds. Federal and state laws require these tax payments. Assuming all employees earn less than $\mathbb{S}200{,}000$ , the FICA tax amount is equal to the amount that is paid by employees:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Compensation expense (+E,-SE)</td><td>148,500</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FICA payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>137,700</td></tr><tr><td>FUTA payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>2,300</td></tr><tr><td>SUTA payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>8,500</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Assets 一</td><td>Liabilities</td><td>十</td><td>Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>  

FICA payable +137,700 Compensation expense $\left(+\mathrm{E}\right)$ −148,500   
FUTA payable + 2,300   
SUTA payable +8,500  

## Deferred Revenues  

In most business transactions, cash is paid when a product or service is delivered, or soon there­ after. In some cases, however, cash is paid in advance of delivery. You probably have paid for an airline ticket in advance. The airline company receives cash for the ticket you purchased, but it does not provide the service (the flight) until a future date. When a company collects cash before the related revenue has been earned, the cash is called deferred revenues, or, occasionally, unearned revenues. Under the revenue recognition principle introduced in Chapter 3, revenue cannot be recorded until it has been earned. Deferred revenues are reported as a liability because cash has been collected from customers, but the company has not delivered a product or service, and thus the related revenue has not been earned by the end of the accounting period. The obligation to provide a product or service in the future still exists. These obligations are classified as current or long term, depending on when a company expects to provide the product or service.  

A Starbucks card, which allows customers to pay for their purchases in advance, is an example of deferred revenues. Advantages for the customer include convenience at the point of sale and the accumulation of loyalty rewards. Advantages for Starbucks include the ability to collect and use customers’ cash before they actually purchase anything, while also collecting information on the purchasing habits of individual customers. Starbucks’s balance sheet shown in Exhibit 9.1 reports that the current liability at the end of fiscal 2020 associated with unused Starbucks cards totaled $\mathbb{S}1{,}456.5$ million. Starbucks explains the amount with the following note:  

“Amounts loaded onto stored value cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon redemption.”  

![](images/2fe6ec19d97f48d32822492f13916d491ca5dbfec5cd595fa2fbdf8479cb6509.jpg)  

Deferred revenues are a liability until the company earns the revenues by delivering a good or service to customers.

Starbucks has historically used the phrase “stored value cards” even though many customers today carry their balance on their mobile app and not on a physical card. Regardless, the accounting for Starbucks is the same. When the company receives cash from the customer it increases its “stored value card liability” by the amount of cash received. When the customer later places an order, Starbucks reduces its “stored value card liability” by the amount of the order and recognizes revenue. This latter entry is an example of an adjusting journal entry, which we covered in Chapter 4.  

## BUSINESS ANALYTICS  

## Using mobile app data to understand customer behavior  

At the end of 2020, nearly a quarter of all transactions at Starbucks were completed using its mobile app. Were you one of them? If so, you provide data that Starbucks collects and analyzes to help them make informed operating decisions. For example, Starbucks uses artificial intelligence software to analyze how a customer’s purchase history is associated with things like geographic location, weather, day of the week, and time of the day. Starbucks uses the output of this analysis to decide what products to emphasize in a given geographic location, and when to push information about these products to customers. The company uses similar software to analyze where to locate new stores. The next time you purchase a product at Starbucks pause to consider that your purchase data will be used to create the company’s next annual report, and quite likely, the next special offer you receive on your phone.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 9-3  

Report notes payable and explain the time value of money.  

![](images/7ce455e095133501ec177519b27aa48ff999e55866b03ce8e8d2a1c86d267800.jpg)  

To calculate interest for a period you need: (1)  

the principle amount of the loan and (2) the interest rate per period.  

## Notes Payable  

When a company borrows money, it normally signs a formal written contract with a bank and reports the amount borrowed as a note payable. The contract specifies the amount borrowed, the date by which it must be repaid, and the interest rate associated with the borrowing.  

Banks and other creditors are willing to lend cash because they will earn interest in return. Earning interest by loaning money to others reflects the time value of money. To the borrower, interest reflects the cost of using someone else’s money and is therefore an expense. To lenders, interest reflects the benefit of allowing someone else to use their money and is therefore revenue. You need two pieces of information to calculate interest: (1) the principle (i.e., the cash that was borrowed) and (2) the interest rate per period. To calculate the interest rate per period you may need to adjust the annual interest rate to a monthly, weekly, or even daily rate. For example, the formula based on a monthly rate is  

Principa $\times$ Annual Interest Rate $\times$ Number of Months/12 Months $=$ Interest for the Period  

To illustrate, assume that on November 1, a company with a December 31 fiscal year-end borrows $^{\S100,000}$ cash for six months. The annual interest rate is 12 percent. The principle and interest are payable on April 30 of the following year. The note is recorded in the accounts as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Cash (+A)</td><td>100,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Notes payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td>Liabilities</td><td>+</td><td>Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Cash +100,000 Notes Payable +100,000 $^+$ Cash $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ (principal) $^+$ Interest expense $\mathbb{S}2,000$ $^+$ Note payable $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ $^+$ Interest payable $\mathbb{S}2,000$  

![](images/f9f2d23218a4f41a994934734140686d92d66afada6757f06578dfb8eb02e68d.jpg)  

April 30, Year 2 $^+$ Interest expense \$4,000 $^+$ Interest payable \$4,000 – Interest payable $\mathbb{S}6,000$ – Note payable \$100,000 – Cash \$106,000 (principa $^+$ interest)  

Interest is an expense incurred when companies borrow money. Companies record interest expense for a given accounting period, regardless of when they actually pay the bank cash for interest. In the above example, the company borrowed the money on November 1. By the end of the fiscal year, December 31, the company has incurred two months of interest expense. Because the company will not pay interest until April 30, it will report a current liability on its balance sheet to reflect the future obligation to the bank.  

The computation to determine the amount of interest incurred during the two months and the associated liability is  

![](images/a9397adeb0dcfd34122e441227cef13fd87b4d514c174b044211ec4a36b0917c.jpg)  

The entry to record interest expense and interest payable for the two months is  

Interest payable $+2{,}000$ Interest expense $\left(+\mathrm{E}\right)$ −2,000   


<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Interestexpense (+E,-SE)</td><td>2,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Interest payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities +</td><td colspan="2">Stockholders' Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>  

On April 30, the company has incurred an additional four months of interest expense for the period January–April. The entry to record this expense and the associated liability is  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Interestexpense (+E,-SE)</td><td>4,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Interest payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Assets 一 Liabilities</td><td colspan="2">+ Stockholders' Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>

Interest payable $+4{,}000$ Interest expense $\left(+\mathrm{E}\right)$ −4,000  

Also on April 30, the company pays the bank $\mathbb{S}6{,}000$ cash for six months of interest and pays back the principal since the loan was a six-month loan. The cash payment for interest consists of the $\mathbb{S}2{,}000$ of interest owed for November and December, plus the $\mathbb{S}4{,}000$ of interest owed for January–April. The following journal entry reflects the cash payment to the bank to repay the principal amount and to pay for interest.  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Interestpayable (-L)</td><td>6,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Notes payable (-L)</td><td>100,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>106,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Assets Liabilities + Stockholders'Equit</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Cash −106,000 Interest payable −6,000   
Note payable −100,000  

## Current Portion of Long-Term Debt  

The distinction between current and long-term debt is important for both managers and analysts. A company must have sufficient cash on hand to repay current debt. To provide accurate information on how much of its long-term debt is due in the current year, a company must reclassify its long-term debt as a current liability within a year of its maturity date. For example, as shown in Exhibit 9.1 and highlighted below, Starbucks expects to pay $\Phi1,249.9\$ million of its long-term debt in the current year. The remaining $\Phi14,659.6\$ million is due sometime after the current year.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Sept.27,2020 Sept.29,2019</td></tr><tr><td>Currentliabilities:</td></tr><tr><td>Currentp portion of long-term debt 1,249.9</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term debt 14,659.6 11,167.0</td></tr></table></body></html>  

In the footnotes to its 2020 Annual Report, Starbucks explains that its long-term debt consists of notes that mature on various dates out to 2050. Accounting for these long-term notes is a lot like accounting for bonds, which we will cover in Chapter 10.  

## Refinancing Debt: Current or Long-Term Liability?  

Instead of repaying a loan from current cash, a company may refinance it either by negotiating a new loan agreement with a new maturity date or by taking out a new loan and using the proceeds to pay off the old loan. If a company intends to refinance a currently maturing loan with a new long-term loan and has the ability to do so, the current loan should be classified as a long-term liability. It is not a current liability because current liabilities are short-term obligations that are expected to be paid with current assets within the current operating cycle or one year, whichever is longer.  

LEARNING OBJECTIVE 9-4 Report contingent liabilities.  

## Contingent Liabilities Reported on the Balance Sheet  

Some recorded liabilities are based on estimates because the exact amount will not be known until a future date. For example, a contingent liability is created when a company offers a warranty with a product it sells. The cost of providing future repair work must be estimated and recorded as a liability (and expense) in the period in which the product is sold.  

As an example, assume Starbucks estimates that it will have to provide $\mathbb{S}150{,}000$ of warranty services to customers who purchased coffee brewing equipment this year. In addition to recording the sale of the brewing equipment, Starbucks would record the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Warrantyexpense (+E,-SE)</td><td>150,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Warranty payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>150,000</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities</td><td colspan="2">+ Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>

Warranty payable +150,000 Warranty expense $\left(+\mathrm{E}\right)$ −150,000  

Over time, as customers return defective equipment, Starbucks would decrease the warranty payable account and either refund the customer cash or fix the equipment and return it to the customer.  

## Contingent Liabilities Reported in the Footnotes  

Each of the liabilities that we have discussed is reported on the balance sheet at a specific dollar amount because each involves the probable future sacrifice of economic benefits. Some transactions or events create only a reasonably possible (but not probable) future sacrifice of economic benefits. These situations create contingent liabilities that are reported in the footnotes, but not on a company’s balance sheet.  

Whether a contingent liability is reported on the balance sheet, in the notes to the financial statements, or not at all depends on two factors: (1) the probability of a future economic sacrifice and (2) the ability of management to estimate the amount of the liability. The following table illustrates the possibilities:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Probable</td><td>ReasonablyPossible</td><td>Remote</td></tr><tr><td>Amountcanbereasonablyestimated</td><td>Recordasliability</td><td>Discloseinfootnotes</td><td>Disclosure not required</td></tr><tr><td>Amountcannotbereasonablyestimated</td><td>Discloseinfootnotes</td><td>Discloseinfootnotes</td><td>Disclosurenotrequired</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The probabilities of occurrence are defined in the following manner:  

•	 Probable–The future event or events are likely to occur.   
•	 Reasonably possible–The chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely.   
•	 Remote–The chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.  

## Contingent Liability Examples

## INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE  

## It’s a Matter of Degree  

The assessment of future probabilities is inherently subjective, but both U.S. GAAP and IFRS provide some guidance. Under U.S. GAAP, “probable” has been defined as likely to occur, which is commonly interpreted to mean having a greater than 70 percent chance of occurring. Under IFRS, “probable” is defined as more likely than not to occur, which implies more than a 50 percent chance of occurring. This difference means that for some contingent liabilities, IFRS would require the reporting of a liability on the balance sheet whereas GAAP would simply require footnote disclosure.  

In summary,  

•	 A liability that is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated must be recorded and reported on the balance sheet.   
•	 A liability that is (1) probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or (2) reasonably possible regardless of whether the amount can be estimated, must be disclosed in a footnote.   
•	 Remote contingencies do not require any type of disclosure.  

Since 2010, Starbucks has been fighting a lawsuit in the State of California. Below are excerpts from Starbucks’s 2020 Annual Report pertaining to this lawsuit:  

On April 13, 2010, an organization named Council for Education and Research on Toxics (“Plaintiff”) filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California. . .  

. . Plaintiff alleges that the Company and the other defendants failed to provide warnings for their coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under California Health and Safety Code section 25249.5, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition 65. . . The Plaintiff asserts that every consumed cup of coffee, absent a compliant warning, is equivalent to a violation under Proposition 65. . .  

The Company, as part of a joint defense group organized to defend against the lawsuit, disputes the claims of the Plaintiff. Acrylamide is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts (parts per billion) as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process. . . On June 22, 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) proposed a new regulation clarifying that cancer warnings are not required for coffee under Proposition 65.  

On June 3, 2019, the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved the coffee exemption regulation. . . The plaintiff has not yet filed a Notice of Appeal. Starbucks believes that the likelihood that the Company will ultimately incur a loss in connection with this litigation is less than reasonably possible. Accordingly, no loss contingency was recorded for this matter.

Consistent with the table shown earlier, Starbucks has not recorded a liability because management deemed a loss to be “less than reasonably possible.” Therefore, disclosure in a footnote was sufficient.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 9-5  

Explain the importance of working capital and its impact on cash flows.  

## Working Capital Management  

Information about current liabilities is very important to managers and analysts because these obligations must be paid in the near future. Analysts say that a company has liquidity if it has the ability to meet its current obligations. A number of financial measures are useful in evaluating liquidity, including the current ratio (introduced in Chapter 2) and the dollar amount of working capital. Working capital is defined as the dollar difference between current assets and current liabilities. Working capital is important to both managers and financial analysts because it has a significant impact on the health and profitability of a company. Starbucks’s working capital at the end of fiscal 2020 was:  

## Current assets−Current liabilities $=$ Working capital \$7,806.4 \$7,346.8 \$459.6  

Working capital reflects the amount Starbucks would have left over if it used all of its current assets to pay off all of its current liabilities.  

Managers actively manage working capital accounts to achieve a balance between a company’s short-term obligations and the resources to satisfy those obligations. If a business has too little working capital, it runs the risk of not being able to meet its obligations. On the other hand, too much working capital may tie up resources in unproductive assets. Excess inventory, for example, ties up dollars that could be invested more profitably elsewhere in the business and incurs additional costs associated with storage and deterioration.  

Changes in working capital accounts are also important to managers and analysts because they have a direct impact on the cash flows from operating activities reported on the statement of cash flows.  

## F O C U S  ON  CASH F LOW S  

## Working Capital and Cash Flows  

Many working capital accounts have a direct relationship to income-producing activities. Accounts receivable, for example, are related to sales revenue: Accounts receivable increase when sales are made on credit. Cash is collected when customers pay their bills. Similarly, accounts payable increase when inventory is purchased on credit. A cash outflow occurs when the account is paid. We discuss how to use changes in working capital accounts to create the operating section of the statement of cash flows in Chapter 12.  

Companies classify liabilities as either current or long term. Our discussion to this point has focused on current liabilities, which are short-term obligations that will be paid in cash (or other current assets) within the current operating cycle or one year, whichever is longer. In the next section, we turn our attention to long-term liabilities. Before you move on, complete the following questions to test your understanding of the concepts we have covered.  

For each of the following events, state whether Starbucks’s working capital will increase, decrease, or not change:  

1.	 Starbucks purchases inventory on credit.   
2.	 Starbucks borrows $^{\Phi1,000,000}$ in long-term debt.   
3.	 Starbucks pays cash to reduce its rent payable account by $\mathbb{S}750{,}000$ .   
4.	 Starbucks pays employee salaries with cash.

## LONG-TERM LIABILITIES  

Report long-term liabilities.  

Long-term liabilities include all obligations that are not classified as current liabilities, such as long-term notes payable and bonds payable. Most companies borrow money on a long-term basis in order to purchase assets, like property or equipment. In some cases, a company may pledge specific assets as security for repayment. If the company defaults on the loan, then the bank has the right to take ownership of the assets. A loan supported by this type of agreement is called secured debt. Agreements in which the bank relies primarily on the borrower’s integrity and general earning power to repay the loan are called unsecured debt.  

## Long-Term Notes Payable and Bonds  

Companies can raise capital directly from a number of financial service organizations including banks, insurance companies, and pension plans. Raising capital from one of these organizations is known as a private placement. The resulting liability often is called a note payable, which is a written promise to pay a stated sum at one or more specified future dates called the maturity date(s).  

In many cases, a company’s need for capital exceeds the financial ability of any single bank or other creditor. In these situations, the company may issue publicly traded debt called bonds. The opportunity to sell a bond security in established markets provides bondholders with an important benefit. Without involving the company, bondholders can sell their bond securities to other investors prior to maturity if they have an immediate need for cash. We will discuss bonds in detail in the next chapter.  

Accounting for long-term debt is based on the same concepts used in accounting for shortterm debt. A liability is recorded when the debt is incurred and interest expense is recorded with the passage of time.  

Business operations are global in nature, with many corporations operating manufacturing facilities around the world. In order to support these foreign operations, companies sometimes borrow money from foreign banks. Borrowing money in a foreign currency raises some interesting accounting and management issues.  

## INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE  

## Borrowing in Foreign Currencies  

Many corporations with foreign operations elect to finance those operations with foreign debt to lessen exchange rate risk. Exchange rate risk exists because the relative value of each nation’s currency varies on virtually a daily basis.  

In attempting to mitigate exchange rate risk, Amazon.com states the following in the footnotes to its 2020 Annual Report:  

## AMAZON  

REAL WORLD EXCERPT: Notes to the Financial Statements  

“Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores. . .are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen.”  

## AMAZON  

REAL WORLD EXCERPT: Notes to the Financial Statements  

For reporting purposes, accountants must convert, or translate, foreign debt into U.S. dollars at the end of the accounting period in order to report the debt on a U.S. company’s balance sheet. In the same footnote excerpted above, Amazon.com discusses how it does this by stating:  

“Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. . 99  

## Lease Liabilities  

Companies often lease assets rather than purchase them. We saw this reflected on Chipotle’s balance sheet in Chapter 2. When a company leases an asset, it enters into a contractual agreement with the owner of the asset. In the language of contracts (and accounting), the party that owns the asset is referred to as the lessor. The party that pays for the right to use the asset is referred to as the lessee. We focus on accounting for leases from the lessee’s perspective. For accounting purposes, a lessee can lease an asset by signing either a short-term lease (12 months or less) or a longer-term lease. Longer-term leases are more common and are classified as either finance leases or operating leases depending on whether effective control of the leased asset remains with the lessor or is transferred to the lessee.  

## Accounting for finance leases and operating leases  

How do accountants determine if a longer-term lease should be recorded as a finance lease or an operating lease? GAAP helps guide them through this determination by stating that if a lease meets any of the following five criteria, it is considered a finance lease:  

a.	 The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.   
b.	 The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.   
c.	 The lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset. . . .   
d.	 The present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee . . . equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset.   
e.	 The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.\*  

The five criteria are aimed at establishing whether the lessor maintains effective control of the leased asset or whether effective control has been transferred to the lessee. If any of the five criteria are met, then effective control (i.e., substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership) is transferred to the lessee and the lease is a finance lease. If none of the criteria are met, then effective control remains with the lessor and the lease is an operating lease.  

The accounting required to initially record a finance lease and an operating lease is the same: Both require the recognition of a lease asset and a lease liability. The amount recognized is the current cash equivalent of the required future lease payments. Assume that Starbucks signs a four-year lease for a new delivery truck and that Starbucks’s accountants have determined that the current cash equivalent of the lease is $\mathbb{S}250{,}000$ . Upon signing the lease, Starbucks records the following entry:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Lease asset (+A)</td><td>250,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Lease liability (+L)</td><td>+</td><td>250,000 Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities 一</td></tr></table></body></html>

Lease asset +250,000 Lease liability +250,000  

Accounting for the lease over its life differs depending on whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. The differences are discussed in detail in more advanced accounting courses. At this point, just keep in mind two key aspects of accounting for longer-term leases. First, regardless of whether the lease is determined to be a finance lease or an operating lease, the company must record a lease asset and a lease liability upon signing the lease agreement. Second, the amount recorded as the lease asset and the lease liability is the current cash equivalent of the required future lease payments. In the above example, you were given the current cash equivalent of the lease. In the next section, we will learn how accountants compute current cash equivalents, commonly referred to as present values.  

## Accounting for short-term leases  

A short-term lease is a lease for 12 months or less (including expected renewals and extensions) that does not contain a purchase option that the lessee is expected to exercise. A company does not record a lease asset or a lease liability when it signs a short-term lease. Instead the company simply records lease expense over the life of the lease. As an example of a short-term lease, assume that on December 31, Starbucks signs a short-term lease agreement to rent five delivery trucks for the month of January. The agreement stipulates that Starbucks must pay $\mathbb{S}10{,}000$ at the end of January. No entry is recorded at the time the lease is signed on December 31. The only entry recorded comes at the end of January to recognize lease expense:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Lease expense (+E,-SE)</td><td>10,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Assets Liabilities + 一</td><td colspan="2">Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Cash -10,000</td><td colspan="2">Leasee expense (+E) -10,000</td></tr></table></body></html>  

## COMPUTING PRESENT VALUES  

Our discussion of longer-term leases raises an interesting question about liabilities: Is the liability today the amount of cash that will be paid in the future? For example, if I agree to pay you $\mathbb{S}10{,}000$ five years from now, should I report a liability of $\mathbb{S}10{,}000$ on my personal balance sheet? If I can earn interest on my money, the answer is “no.” To understand why, it is important for you to understand that money invested in an interest-bearing account grows over time. We briefly introduced this concept earlier in the chapter and referred to it as the time value of money. The time value of money plays an important role in how companies report long-term liabilities, such as long-term notes as well as bonds, the topic of Chapter 10.  

Compute and explain present values.  

The concept of present value (PV) is based on the time value of money. Quite simply, money received today is worth more than money to be received one year from today (or at any other future date) because it can be used to earn interest. If you invest $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ today at 10 percent, you will have $\mathbb{S}1\!,\!100$ in one year. In contrast, if you receive $\Phi1\!,\!000$ one year from today, you will lose the opportunity to earn the $\mathbb{S}100$ in interest revenue. The difference between the $\Phi1\!,\!000$ and the $^{\S1,100}$ is the interest that can be earned during the year, which reflects the time value of money.  

In one of your math classes, you have probably already solved some problems involving the time value of money. In the typical problem, you are told a certain dollar amount has been deposited in a savings account earning a specified rate of interest. You are asked to compute the dollar amount in the savings account after a certain number of years. This is an example of a future value (FV) problem: How much is a given dollar amount today worth in the future if it grows at a specified interest rate? For example, if you deposited $\mathbb{S}100$ today in a savings account that earns 10 percent interest, how much would you have after one year?

## ANSWER: $\bf{5110}$  

In this chapter we focus on how to solve the opposite problem. In present value problems, you are asked to compute the amount you would need to deposit today at a specified interest rate to have a given dollar amount in the future. For example, if you needed $\mathbb{S}110$ in one year, how much would you need to deposit in a savings account today if the savings account earns 10 percent interest?

## ANSWER: $\mathbf{5100}$  

There are two basic types of present value problems: those involving single amounts like the example above and those involving a stream of future amounts. Understanding and being able to compute both types is important when accounting for certain long-term liabilities.  

## Present Value of a Single Amount  

To compute the present value of a single amount, you must discount the amount to be received or paid in the future at $i$ interest rate for $n$ periods. The formula to compute the present value of a single amount is  

While the formula is not difficult to use, most analysts use present value tables, calculators, or Excel. We strongly encourage you to visit Connect for tutorials on how to compute present values using each of these tools. To do so, see “Guided Help $9{-}2^{\circ}$ on the next page. For the examples that follow, we provide the inputs required to compute each present value using tables, calculators, and Excel.  

Assume that today is January 1, 2022, and you need to make a $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ cash payment on December 31, 2024. At an interest rate of 10 percent per year, how much would you need to deposit today to have exactly $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ on December 31, 2024? You could discount the amount year by year to figure out how much you would need to deposit today, but it is easier to use Table E.1, Appendix E, Present Value of $\mathbb{S}1.$ For $i=10\%$ , $n=3$ periods, we find that the present value factor is 0.75131. The present value of $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ to be paid at the end of three years can be computed as follows:  

$$
\hphantom{0}\S1,000\times0.75131=\S751.31
$$  

Once you have computed a present value amount, it is important that you understand what it means. The $\mathbb{S}751.31\$ is the amount you would have to deposit today in order to have exactly $\mathbb{S}1\!,\!000$ three years from today, assuming an interest rate of 10 percent. Conceptually, you should be indifferent between paying $\mathbb{S}751.31\$ today and paying $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ in three years. If you had $\mathbb{S}751.3\$ 1 today and did not want to worry about having to come up with $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ in three years, you could simply deposit the money in a savings account and at 10 percent interest it would grow to $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ in three years. How the deposit of $\mathbb{S}751.31\$ grows to equal $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ is shown in Exhibit 9.2.  

From Table E.1: interest rate $(i)=10\%$ , periods $(n)=3$ : Factor $=0.75131$   
Using Calculator: rate $(i)=10$ , periods $(n)=3$ , $\mathrm{pmt}=\mathbb{S}0,\,\mathrm{FV}=-\mathbb{S}1{,}000$   
Using Excel: Rate $(i)=.10$ , Nper $(n)=3$ , $\mathrm{Pmt}={\mathfrak{S}}0,\,\mathrm{Fv}=-{\mathfrak{S}}1{,}000$

## Present Value of an Annuity  

Instead of a single amount, many business problems involve multiple cash payments over a number of periods. An annuity is a series of consecutive payments characterized by  

1.	An equal dollar amount each period.   
2.	Interest periods of equal length (e.g., a year, half a year, quarterly, or monthly).   
3.	The same interest rate each period.  

Examples of annuities include monthly rent payments on an apartment or quarterly lease payments on a car.  

We compute the present value of an annuity by discounting each of the equal periodic amounts back to today. The present value of an annuity of $\mathbb{S}1$ for three periods at 10 percent may be represented graphically as follows:  

![](images/eab0975f01a8937f412ca7444da74b9a07849360b09559d6b250bac72105fa23.jpg)

Applying this concept to a purchase decision, assume you purchase a piece of equipment and agree to pay $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ cash each December 31 for three years. How much would you need to deposit today at an annual interest rate of 10 percent to make each $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ payment? We could use Table E.1, Appendix E, to calculate the present value as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Amount</td><td>Factor from Table E. 1, Appendix E,i =10%</td><td></td><td>Present Value</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>$1,000</td><td>0.90909 (n = 1)</td><td>=</td><td>$ 909.09</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>$1,000</td><td>0.82645 (n = 2)</td><td>=</td><td>$ 826.45</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>$1,000</td><td>0.75131 (n = 3)</td><td>三</td><td>$751.31</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Total present value</td><td>=</td><td>$2,486.85</td></tr></table></body></html>

1. The present value will decrease. 2. $\mathbb{8}10,000\times0.61391=\mathbb{8}6,139.10$  

We can compute the present value of this annuity more easily, however, by using Table E.2, Appendix E, as follows:  

$$
\S1,000\times2.48685=\S2,486.85
$$  

Let’s now connect the amount we computed above to the three required $\Phi1\!,\!000$ payments. As shown in Exhibit 9.3, if you deposited $\mathbb{S}2,486.85$ today at an interest rate of 10 percent, that amount would grow to $\mathbb{S}2{,}735{.}54$ after one year $(\mathbb{S}2,486.85+$ interest of $\mathbb{S}248.69)$ ). At that point you would make your first $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ payment and have $\mathbb{S}1,735.54$ left. The $\mathbb{S}1,735.54$ would grow to $\Phi1{,}909{.}09\$ over the next year $^{(\S1,735.54+}$ interest of $\mathbb{S}173.551\$ ). At that point you would make your second $\Phi1\!,\!000$ payment and have $\mathbb{S}909.09\$ left. The $\mathbb{S}909.09\$ would grow to exactly $^{\mathparagraph1,000}\$ over the next year $^{\leftmoon}\rightmoon09.09\,+$ interest of $\mathbb{S}90.91\$ ), and you would be able to make your last $\mathbb{s}1{,}000$ payment. Thus, at an interest rate of 10 percent, depositing $\mathbb{S}2,486.85$ today would allow you to make the three required $\Phi1\!,\!000$ payments at the end of the next three years.

## Interest Rates and Interest Periods  

The preceding illustrations assumed annual periods for compounding and discounting. Although interest rates are almost always quoted on an annual basis, most compounding periods encountered in business are less than one year. When interest periods are less than a year, the values of $\displaystyle{n}$ and $i$ must be adjusted to be consistent with the length of the interest period.  

To illustrate, 12 percent interest compounded annually for five years requires the use of $n=5$ and $i=12\%$ . If compounding is quarterly, however, the interest period is one-quarter of a year (i.e., four periods per year), and the quarterly interest rate is one-quarter of the annual rate (i.e., 3 percent per quarter). Therefore, 12 percent interest compounded quarterly for five years requires use of $n=20$ and $i=3\%$ .  

From Table E.2: interest rate $(i)=10\%$ , periods $(n)=3$ : Factor $=2.48685$   
Using Calculator: rate $(i)=10$ , periods $(n)=3$ , $\mathrm{pmt}=-\mathbb{S}1,000,\,\mathrm{FV}=\mathbb{S}0$   
Using Excel: Rate $(i)=0.10$ , Nper $(n)=3$ , $\mathrm{\DeltaPmt}=-\mathbb{S}1,000,\,\mathrm{Fv}=\mathbb{S}0$

For example, perhaps you have seen advertisements that promise “No payments for one year!” It is important to realize that “no payments” does not mean “no interest.” In almost all cases, during the “no payments” year, interest is accruing (being added to the amount owed) and, depending on the interest rate, can add significantly to the total amount customers must pay back.  

Another misleading advertisement relates to lotteries, which often promise to make winners instant millionaires. In some cases, however, the lottery amount is paid out over a long period of time, for example, $\mathbb{S}25{,}000$ each year for 40 years. The winner will receive $^{\Phi1,000,000}$ $^{\,\!}\mathbb{S}25,\!000\times40$ years), but the present value of this annuity at 8 percent is only $\mathbb{S}298{,}000$ . While most winners are happy to get the money, they are not really millionaires.  

Now that you understand the time value of money, keep an eye out for advertisements that include dollar amounts in the future. There are a lot of them out there, and knowing how to compute present values will help you more fully understand their implications.  

## LEARNING OBJECTIVE 9-8  

Apply the present value concept to the reporting of long-term liabilities.  

From Table E.1: interest rate $(i)=12\%$ , periods $(n)=2$ : Factor $=0.79719$   
Using Calculator: rate $(i)=12$ , periods $(n)=2$ , $\mathrm{pmt}=\mathbb{S}0,\,\mathrm{FV}=-\mathbb{S}200,000$   
Using Excel: Rate $(i)=0.12$ , Nper $(n)=2$ , Pmt = \$0, $\mathrm{Fv}=-\mathbb{8}200,000$  

## Accounting Applications of Present Values  

Many business transactions that affect long-term liabilities require accountants to compute present values. We provide three brief examples below before transitioning to accounting for bonds in the next chapter.  

## Computing the Amount of a Liability with a Single Payment  

Assume that on January 1, 2022, Starbucks bought new delivery trucks by signing a note and agreeing to pay $\mathbb{S}200{,}000$ on December 31, 2023. This type of arrangement is often referred to as a “non-interest-bearing” note because no interest payments are required over the life of the note. Do not confuse “non-interest-bearing” with “no interest.” The interest is simply built into the final payment, in this case the $\mathbb{S}200{,}000$ payment on December 31, 2023. Assume that the annual market interest rate applicable to the note is 12 percent.  

To record this transaction, Starbucks’s accountants first must compute the present value of the single amount to be paid in the future. The problem can be shown graphically as follows:  

![](images/b86965089879903fe8e5edd3bbfadb96262242eb30334458d2fa9e28d293df6b.jpg)  

The present value of the $\mathbb{S}200{,}000$ payment is computed as follows:  

$$
\Phi200,000\times0.79719=\Phi159,438
$$  

After computing the present value, Starbucks records the following journal entry:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Delivery trucks (+A)</td><td>159,438</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Note payable (+L)</td><td>+</td><td>159,438 Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Assets Liabilities</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Delivery trucks +159,438 Note payable +159,438  

At the end of each year, Starbucks must record the implied interest expense.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>December 31,2022</td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Interest expense (+E,-SE)</td><td>19,133*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Notep payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>19,133</td></tr></table></body></html>  

$^{*}\mathbb{S}159{,}438$ note payable balance $\times\,0.12$ annual interest rate $={\mathbb{S}}19{,}133$ . When added to $^{\S159,438}$ , the note payable balance is now $\mathbb{S}178{,}571$ .  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Assets</td><td>Liabilities +</td><td>Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Note payable +19,133</td><td>Interest expense (+E) -19,133</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>December 31,2023</td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Intereste expense (+E,-SE)</td><td>21,429*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Note payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>21,429</td></tr></table></body></html>

$^{\ast}\mathbb{S}178{,}571$ note payable balance $\times\,0.12$ annual interest rate $={\mathbb{S}21,429}$ . When added to $^{\S178,571}$ , the note payable balance is now $\mathbb{S}200{,}000$ .  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Assets</td><td>Liabilities 十</td><td>Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Note payable +21,429</td><td>Interest expense (+E) -21,429</td></tr></table></body></html>  

At the end of two years, Starbucks must repay the loan amount. The amount owed is the balance in the note payable account, which started at $^{\mathbb{5159},438}$ and grew as we added interest over the two-year period to now equal exactly $\mathbb{S}200{,}000$ $(\Phi159,\!438+\Phi19,\!133+\Phi21,\!429)$ ). To repay the loan, Starbucks would record the following journal entry:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>December31,2023</td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Note payable (-L)</td><td>200,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>200,000</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities</td><td colspan="2">十 Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>

Cash −200,000 Note payable −200,000  

## Computing the Amount of a Liability with an Annuity  

On January 1, 2022, assume Starbucks bought several new espresso machines. The company elected to finance the purchase with a note payable to be paid off in three end-of-year payments of $\mathbb{S}163{,}685$ . Each payment includes principal plus interest on any unpaid balance. The annual interest rate is 11 percent. Payments are due on December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. This problem can be shown graphically as follows:  

![](images/21b46eaba0d565c7ebf46fbc2a426c314c6d814fe78ea58967690b1507dca2ff.jpg)  

The present value of the note is the amount Starbucks would have to deposit today at 11 percent interest to cover the three $\mathbb{S}163{,}685$ payments. This is an annuity because payments are made in three equal installments. The present value of the note is computed as follows:  

$$
\S163,\S85\times2.44371=\S399,\S99
$$  

When Starbucks purchases the new espresso machines on January 1, 2022, it records the following journal entry:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>January 1,2022</td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Espresso machines (+A)</td><td>399,999</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Note payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>399,999</td></tr><tr><td>Assets Liabilities</td><td>十</td><td>Stockholders'Equit</td></tr></table></body></html>  

From Table E.2: interest rate $(i)=11\%$ , periods $(n)=3$ : Factor $=2.44371$   
Using Calculator: rate $(i)=11$ , periods $(n)=3$ , $\mathrm{pmt}=-\mathbb{S}{163}{,685},\mathrm{FV}=\mathbb{S}0$   
Using Excel: Rate $(i)=0.11$ , Nper $(n)=3$ , $\mathrm{Pmt}=-\mathbb{S}163,685,\mathrm{Fv}=\mathbb{S}0$  

At the end of each year over the three-year life of the note, Starbucks records the following journal entries:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>December31,2022</td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Note payable (-L)</td><td>119,685</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Interestexpense (+E,-SE)</td><td>44,000*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>163,685</td></tr></table></body></html>

$^{*}\mathbb{S}399{,}999$ note payable balance $\times\,0.11$ annual interest rate $=\mathbb{S}44{,}000$ . The remaining payable balance after recording this entry is $^{\S280,314}$ .  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Assets</td><td>Liabilities + Note payable</td></tr><tr><td>Cash -163,685</td><td>Stockholders'Equity -119,685 Interest expense (+E) -44,000</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>December31,2023</td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Note payable (-L)</td><td>132,850</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Intereste expense (+E,-SE)</td><td>30,835*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>163,685</td></tr></table></body></html>

$^{*}\mathbb{S}280,314$ note payable balance $\times\,0.11$ annual interest rate $={\S}30{,}{8}3{5}$ . The remaining payable balance after recording this entry is $^{\S147,464}$ .  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Assets -163,685</td><td>Liabilities</td><td>十 Stockholders'Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>Notepayable -132,850</td><td>Interest expense (+E) -30,835</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>December31,2024</td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Note payable (-L)</td><td>147,464</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Interestexpense (+E,-SE)</td><td>16,221*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash (-A)</td><td></td><td>163,685</td></tr></table></body></html>

$^{*}\mathbb{S}147,464$ note payable balance $\times\,0.11$ annual interest rate $=\mathbb{S}16{,}221$ .  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Assets 一</td><td></td><td>Liabilities</td><td>+</td><td>Stockholders'Equity</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Cash −163,685 Note payable −147,464 Interest expense $\left(+\mathrm{E}\right)$ −16,221  

After Starbucks makes the last cash payment of $\mathbb{S}163,685$ , the balance in the Note payable account is zero.  

## Present Values Involving Both an Annuity and a Single Payment  

From Table E.2: interest rate $(i)=1\%$ , periods $(n)=20$ : Factor $=18.04555$ Using Excel or a Calculator: see single calculation below  

In some business situations, a company may agree to make periodic payments (an annuity) in addition to a single payment at the end of the agreement. Assume Starbucks bought new coffee roasting equipment and agreed to pay the supplier $\mathbb{S}1{,}000$ per month for 20 months and an additional $\mathbb{S}40{,}000$ at the end of 20 months. The supplier is charging 12 percent interest per year, or 1 percent per month. In this type of problem, you can determine the present value of the total obligation by computing the present value of each part. In other words, you compute the present value of the annuity and the present value of the single payment and add the two amounts together, as follows:  

Step 1:	 Compute the present value of the annuity using Table E.2, Appendix E:  

$$
\mathbb{1}1.000\times18.04555=\mathbb{5}18.046
$$  

Step 2:	 Compute the present value of the single payment using Table E.1, Appendix E:  

$$
\hphantom{-}\S40,\hphantom{-}000\times0.81954=\S32,782
$$  

$\mathbb{S}{18}{,}046$ (present value of 20 months of annuity payments) + 32,782 (present value of single sum at the end of 20 months) $\overline{{{\Phi50.828}}}$ (present value of the total obligation)  

Using Calculator: rate $(i)=1$ , periods $(n)=20$ , $\mathrm{pmt}\,{=}\,{-}81{,}000$ , $\mathrm{FV}\!=\!-\!\mathbb{8}40{,}000$ Using Excel: Rate $(i)\!=\!0.01$ , Nper $(n)\!=\!20$ , $\mathrm{Pmt}=-\mathbb{8}1\small{,}000$ , $\mathrm{Fv}=-\mathbb{S}40{,}000$  

The $\mathbb{S}50{,}828$ is the present value of all the cash payments that Starbucks must make under this agreement. Starbucks would record this amount as a liability. This amount can be computed as a single calculation using a calculator or Excel.  

In the next chapter, we will use the present value techniques you have just learned to understand how to account for bonds.  

## D E M O N S T R A T I O N  C A S E  

(Try to answer the questions before proceeding to the suggested solutions that follow.) Patagonia completed several transactions during the year. In each case, decide if a liability (or liabilities) should be recorded and, if so, determine the amount. Assume the current date is December 31 and all transactions occurred over the last year.  

1.	 Employees earned salaries of $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ , which have not been paid at year-end.   
2.	 Patagonia borrowed $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ on June 30 at an annual interest rate of 7 percent. As of December 31, no payments associated with this loan have been made.   
3.	 A customer prepaid $\mathbb{S}250$ for a custom waterproof jacket. The customer will pick up the jacket next month.   
4.	 The company lost a lawsuit for $\mathbb{S}250{,}000$ but plans to appeal.   
5.	A new truck was leased for a period equal to 95 percent of the expected life of the truck.   
6.	On December 31, a bank loaned money to Patagonia. Patagonia agreed to repay the bank $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ on December 31 next year. The annual interest rate is 5 percent.   
7.	 Patagonia signed a loan agreement that requires it to pay $^{\S50,000}$ per year for 20 years. The annual interest rate is 8 percent.  

## SUGGESTED SOLUTION  

1.	 A liability of $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ should be recorded.  

2.	 The amount borrowed $\left(\mathbb{S}100,000\right)$ should be recorded as a liability on June 30. In addition, interest accrued but not paid should be recorded as a liability at year-end. This amount is $\mathbb{S}100,000\times7\%\times$ $6/12=\mathbb{8}3{,}500$ .   
3.	 The amount the customer paid $(\mathbb{S}250)$ is a liability (deferred revenue) until the customer picks up the jacket, at which point the $\mathbb{S}250$ becomes revenue.   
4.	 Unless Patagonia can make a convincing argument that it is not probable it will have to pay the $\mathbb{S}250{,}000$ , the company should record the amount as a liability.   
5.	The lease covers 95 percent of the estimated life of the truck, which would be considered a major part of the remaining economic life of the asset. It therefore should be accounted for as a finance lease, and a lease asset and lease liability should be recorded. The amount is the present value of the lease payments (which were not given in the problem).   
6.	Patagonia should record a liability equal to the present value of the obligation. Using Table E.1, Appendix E $i=5\%$ , $n=1$ ), the amount is $\mathbb{5}100,\!000\times0.95238=\mathbb{5}95,\!238$ .   
7.	 Patagonia should record a liability for the present value of the obligation. Using Table E.2, Appendix E $i=8\%$ , $n=20$ ), the amount is $\mathbb{S}50{,}000\times9.81815=\mathbb{S}490{,}908$ .

## Chapter Supplement B  

## Deferred Taxes  

In Chapter 8 you learned that companies follow GAAP for financial reporting but the Internal Revenue Code when creating their tax returns. Following different rules can create what are called temporary tax differences. Temporary tax differences are the result of a company reporting revenues and expenses on its income statement in a different time period than it reports them on its tax return. If the difference between financial reporting and tax reporting will result in a lower tax bill in the future, it results in the creation of an asset. If the difference will result in a higher tax bill in the future, it results in the creation of a liability. We call these assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. In this chapter supplement, we focus on understanding deferred tax liabilities.  

A company creates a deferred tax liability when it:  

•	 Reports revenue on this period’s income statement that it does not report on its tax return until a future period or   
•	 Reports an expense on this period’s tax return that it does not report on its income statement until a future period.  

Both circumstances result in this period’s accounting income reported on the income statement being higher than this period’s tax income reported on the company’s tax return. An example is when a company pays expenses in advance. In certain situations, the company includes the advance payment as an expense on its tax return in the period it pays the cash. For financial reporting purposes, the company is required to recognize the advance payment as an asset on its balance sheet until it actually incurs the expense in a future period. When this happens, the company then uses the asset to satisfy the expense.  

Another accounting area that often results in a deferred tax liability is depreciation. Many companies use straight-line depreciation for financial reporting purposes and an accelerated depreciation method for tax purposes. Let’s consider a simple example. Assume that in the current year, Starbucks owns a piece of equipment that originally cost $\mathbb{S}10$ million. The current book value (cost less accumulated depreciation) on the balance sheet is $\mathbb{S}8.5$ million. For tax purposes, the book value is $\mathfrak{s}6.5$ million. The $\mathbb{S}2$ million difference is a result of Starbucks using straight-line depreciation for financial reporting and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. Starbucks has been able to delay or defer paying federal income taxes by reporting more depreciation on its tax return than it reports on its income statement.  

The amount of deferred tax liability is computed by multiplying the timing difference by the corporate tax rate (21 percent):  

$$
\mathbf{Deferred\;Tax\;Liability}=\mathbb{S}2\;\mathbf{million}\times\mathbf{0.21}=\mathbb{S}420,\mathbf{0}00
$$  

If there are no other deferred tax items, Starbucks will report a deferred tax liability on its balance sheet of $\mathbb{S}420{,}000$ .  

At the end of the following year, Starbucks again would compare the GAAP book value of the piece of equipment to the tax book value. Assume that the GAAP book value is $\mathbb{S}8.2$ million and the tax book value is $\mathbb{S}6$ million. The timing difference is $\mathbb{S}2.2$ million, resulting in a deferred tax liability of $\mathbb{S}462{,}000$ ( $\mathbb{S}2.2$ million $\times\,0.21$ ).  

The Income tax expense reported under GAAP is the amount needed to complete a journal entry once the company has computed the amount it will pay the IRS for taxes and the change in its deferred taxes. Based on our example, the change in the deferred tax liability for Starbucks is $\mathbb{S}42{,}000$ $(\mathbb{S}462,\!000\,-\!]$ $^{\S420,000)}$ . Assume the company completes its tax return and determines it owes the IRS $\mathbb{S}550{,}000$ for taxes. The company would record the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Debit</td><td>Credit</td></tr><tr><td>Incometaxexpense (+E,-SE)</td><td>592,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Deferred taxes (+L)</td><td></td><td>42,000</td></tr><tr><td>Income taxes payable (+L)</td><td></td><td>550,000</td></tr></table></body></html>

Deferred taxes $+42{,}000$ Income tax expense $\left(+\mathrm{E}\right)$ −592,000 Income taxes payable $+550{,}000$  

The computation of deferred taxes involves some complexities that are discussed in advanced accounting courses. At this point, you need to understand only that deferred tax assets and liabilities are the result of temporary differences between a company’s income statement and its tax return. Each temporary difference has an impact on the income statement in one accounting period and the tax return in another.

## 9-1.	 Define, measure, and report current liabilities. p. 476  

Accountants define liabilities as probable future sacrifices of economic benefits that arise from past transactions. Liabilities are classified on the balance sheet as either current or long term. Current liabilities are short-term obligations that will be paid within the current operating cycle of the business or within one year of the balance sheet date, whichever is longer. Long-term liabilities are all obligations not classified as current.  

9-2.	 Compute and interpret the accounts payable turnover ratio. p. 477  

To compute this ratio, divide cost of goods sold by average accounts payable. This ratio reflects how quickly management is paying its suppliers and is considered to be a measure of liquidity. Liquidity is a company’s ability to meet its current obligations.  

9-3.	 Report notes payable and explain the time value of money. p. 482  

Companies sign a note when they borrow money. The note specifies the amount borrowed, when it must be repaid, and the interest rate associated with the loan. Accountants report the amount borrowed, and any unpaid interest, as liabilities. The time value of money refers to the principle that a given amount of money deposited in an interest-bearing account increases over time.  

## 9-4.	 Report contingent liabilities. p. 484  

A contingent liability is a potential liability that has arisen as the result of a past event. An example is a warranty. The past event is the sale of the item. The potential liability is the possibility that the company will have to honor the warranty. Contingent liabilities are reported on the balance sheet if they are probable and the amount can be estimated. If they are probable but the amount cannot be estimated, or if they are only reasonably possible regardless of whether the amount can be estimated, then they are reported in the footnotes.  

9-5.	 Explain the importance of working capital and its impact on cash flows. p. 486  

Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Working capital is used to fund the operating activities of a business. Changes in working capital accounts are important to managers and analysts because they have a direct impact on the cash flows from operating activities reported on a company’s cash flow statement.  

9-6.	 Report long-term liabilities. p. 487  

Any liability that is not a current liability is a long-term liability. Many long-term liabilities are reported on the balance sheet at their present value, which is the amount a company would have to pay today at a given interest rate to satisfy the obligation.  

9-7.	 Compute and explain present values. p. 489  

The present value concept is based on the time value of money. Money received today is worth more than the same amount of money to be received in the future because of interest rates. We can compute the present value of a single amount or the present value of a stream of amounts (called an annuity) using present value tables, a financial calculator, or Excel.  

9-8.	 Apply the present value concept to the reporting of long-term liabilities. p. 494  

A liability involves the payment of some amount at a future date. With long-term liabilities, the reported liability is not the dollar value of the future payment(s), but rather the present value of the future payment(s).  

In this chapter, we focused on the reporting of current liabilities and introduced how to compute and interpret present values. In the next chapter, we discuss a company’s capital structure and how long-term liabilities, like bonds, fit into that structure.  

Accounts payable turnover is a measure of how quickly a company pays its suppliers. It is computed as follows (see the “Key Ratio Analysis” box in the Current Liabilities section):  

_C_o_s_t_s _o_f_ _G_o_o_d_s_ S_o_l_d_ Accounts Payable Turnover = ​ Average A cco unts  Payabl e ​

## Balance Sheet  

## Income Statement  

Under Current Liabilities Accounts payable Accrued liabilities Deferred revenues Notes payable Current portion of long-term debt   
Under Noncurrent Liabilities Long-term debt Leases Deferred taxes Bonds  

Liabilities are shown only on the balance sheet, never on the income statement. Transactions affecting liabilities often also affect income statement accounts. For example, employee salaries earned but not yet paid affect an income statement account (salary expense) and a balance sheet account (salaries payable).  

## Statement of Cash Flows  

## Notes  

Under Operating Activities Cash inflows and outflows associated with a company’s operations, which often involve working capital accounts (current assets and current liabilities).   
Under Financing Activities Cash inflows and outflows associated with equity and debt, including long-term liabilities like notes and bonds.   
Under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A brief description of the accounting for certain liabilities.   
Under Separate Notes Additional details about both short-term liabilities (e.g., deferred revenue) and long-term liabilities (e.g., notes). Additional details about contingent liabilities, especially legal issues.

## Recording a Note Payable through Its Time to Maturity with Strategy Discussion  

Many businesses borrow money during periods of increased business activity to finance inventory and accounts receivable. Nordstrom, Inc., is one of America’s most prestigious retailers. Each Christmas season, Nordstrom builds up its inventory to meet the needs of Christmas shoppers. A large portion of these Christmas sales are on credit. As a result, Nordstrom often collects cash from the sales several months after Christmas. Assume that on November 1 of this year, Nordstrom borrowed $\mathbb{S}4.8$ million cash from Bank of America to meet short-term obligations. Nordstrom signed an interest-bearing note and promised to repay the $\mathbb{S}4.8$ million in six months. The annual interest rate was 8 percent. All interest will accrue and be paid when the note is due in six months. Nordstrom’s accounting period ends December 31.

a.	 A customer is suing James for $\mathbb{S}1$ million because he claims to have found a piece of glass in his soda. Management deems the probability that James will lose the lawsuit and have to pay $\mathbb{S}1$ million as reasonably possible.  

b.	 An employee is suing James for $\mathbb{S}500{,}000$ for an injury she incurred in the parking lot while walking to work. Management deems the probability that James will lose the lawsuit as probable but estimates that a reasonable payout will be $\mathbb{S}100{,}000$ , not $\mathbb{S}500{,}000$ .   
c.	 A customer is suing James for $\mathbb{S}300{,}000$ because her last name is James and she claims James stole her name. Management deems the probability that James will lose the lawsuit and have to pay \$300,000 as remote.  

Required:  

How should James report each of the lawsuits in its financial statements and footnotes?

## Reporting a Long-Term Liability  

Peloton Corporation sells fitness products and associated subscription services. Effective management of its properties is a key to its success. As the following note in a recent annual report indicates, Peloton leases various types of property:  

The Company leases facilities under operating leases with various expiration dates through 2039. The Company leases space for its corporate headquarters and the operation of its production studio facilities, retail showrooms, microstores, distribution centers, warehouses, factories, and other office spaces  

Required:  

Should Peloton report lease liabilities on its balance sheet? Explain. If the obligation should be reported as a liability, how should the amount be measured?  

## Evaluating Lease Alternatives  

As the new vice president for consumer products at Whole Foods, you are attending a meeting to discuss a serious problem associated with delivering merchandise to customers. Bob Smith, director of logistics, summarized the problem: “It’s easy to understand; we just don’t have enough delivery trucks given our recent growth.” Barb Bader from the accounting department responded: “Maybe it’s easy to understand, but it’s impossible to do anything. Because of Wall Street’s concern about the amount of debt on our balance sheet, we’re under a freeze and can’t borrow money to acquire new assets. There’s nothing we can do.”  

On the way back to your office after the meeting, your assistant offers a suggestion: “Why don’t we just lease the trucks we need using short-term leases that we’ll renew each year? That way we can get the assets we want without having to record a liability on the balance sheet.”  

How would you respond to this suggestion?

## Warranties  

We accrue obligations for warranty costs at the time of sale using a patterned estimation model that includes historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year.  

1.	 Assume that this year Ford paid cash to service warranty claims in the amount of $\mathbb{S}4.0$ billion. Ford also accrued expenses for warranties in the amount of $\mathbb{S}3.9$ billion. If Ford had a balance in its accrued warranties account of $\mathbb{S}1.0$ billion to start the year, what is the balance at the end of the year?

Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc.  

## Calculating and Explaining the Accounts Payable Turnover Ratio (P9-7)  

Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc., is engaged in the manufacture and sale of confectionery products. Assume that last year, Tootsie Roll reported cost of goods sold of $\mathbb{S}352$ million. This year, cost of goods sold was $\mathbb{S}342$ million. Accounts payable was $^{\mathbb{S}\mathbb{1}}$ million at the end of last year and $\mathbb{S}12$ million at the end of this year.  

Required:  

1.	 For this year, compute the average number of days that Tootsie Roll’s accounts payable are outstanding.   
2.	 Assume the confectionery products industry reports an average number of days that accounts payable are outstanding of 30. Comment on Tootsie Roll’s number relative to the industry average.  

## Making Decisions about Contingent Liabilities (P9-8)  

For each of the following situations, determine whether the company should (a) report a liability on the balance sheet, $(b)$ disclose a contingent liability in the footnotes, or (c) not report the situation. Justify your conclusions.  

1.	 A company that manufactures mountain climbing equipment introduces a new type of climbing rope. Past experience demonstrates that lawsuits will be filed as soon as the new rope is involved in any serious climbing accidents. The company believes it is highly probable that at least one jury will award damages to climbers injured in an accident, but it is unable to estimate the amount of any payout.   
2.	 An analyst puts out a report that claims a company’s best-selling product may infringe on another company’s patent. If the other company discovers the infringement and files suit, which is deemed to be highly unlikely, the company could lose millions.   
3.	 As part of a large construction project to build a new dam, your company has polluted a nearby river. Under state law, you must clean up the river once the dam project is complete. The dam project will take eight to ten years to complete. Current estimates indicate that it will cost $\mathbb{S}7$ million to clean up the river.   
4.	 Your company sells coffee and is being sued by a customer who spilled hot coffee on her lap while driving. Due to a faulty lid issue that you are aware of, the probability of the customer winning is deemed to be probable, but the amount of any loss cannot be reliably estimated.   
5.	 A patient is unhappy with the quality of a hip replacement he received. The hospital believes that the patient is being unreasonable but has informed the patient that it will do additional procedures on the hip at no charge to the patient. The procedures will cost the hospital $^{\S50,000}$ .  

## Determining Cash Flow Effects (P9-9)  

For each of the following transactions, determine whether cash flows from operating activities will increase, decrease, or remain the same:

b.	 Paid salaries and wages that were earned last period, but not paid last period.   
c.	 Paid taxes to the federal government.   
d.	 Borrowed money from the bank. The term of the note is two years.   
e.	 Withheld FICA taxes from employees’ paychecks and immediately paid the government.   
f.	 Recorded accrued interest expense.   
g.	 Paid cash as the result of losing a lawsuit. A contingent liability associated with the liability had been recorded.   
h.	 Paid salaries and wages for the current month in cash.   
i.	 Performed services for a customer who had paid for them in the previous accounting period (i.e., deferred revenue is earned).

## Analyzing Hidden Interest in a Real Estate Deal: Present Value  

You are researching the housing market in Bloomington, Indiana, and you come upon an advertisement offering to sell a house for $\mathbb{S}240{,}000$ with a zero interest rate mortgage. All you have to do is agree to make $\mathbb{S}4{,}000$ payments $\langle\mathbb{S}240,\!000\div60$ months) at the end of each month for five years. If you do so, the advertisement says you will not be charged any interest. When you see the offer, mortgages are typically being granted at a 6 percent annual interest rate.  

Required:  

1.	 If the builder demands a 6 percent return on investment, what is the actual value of the house? How much “implied” interest will you pay over the five years as you are paying off the house? The present value factor for an annuity with 60 periods and an interest rate of 0.5 percent (6 percent/12 months) is 51.72556.  

2.	 If the builder is actually demanding a 6 percent return on investment, why would she advertise the mortgage as a “zero interest rate mortgage”?
